## What this is not

Do not expect this plugin to generate 100% production ready code. To get the most out of this plugin:

- Ask designers to always use Blade components in Figma
- Ask designers to use Auto Layout in Figma
- Generate code per design section instead of the whole page

## Usage guide

For installation and usage instructions, please refer to the [usage guide](docs/usage.md).
