# Usage guide for developers

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to properly install and effectively utilize Razorsharp.

## Installation

The plugin is published on Figma private for Razorpay employees for now. If you are a Razorpay employee, you can install the plugin from [here](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1200806396995792369/Razorsharp).

If you are not a Razorpay employee, you can download and build the project locally.

## Usage

### Running the plugin

Figma allows plugins to be run only when the user has edit access to the file. Most developers won't have edit access to the file. So, you will have to create a copy of the file and then run the plugin on that file.

You can duplicate the file by right-clicking on the thumbnail and clicking on "Duplicate".

Open the duplicate file. You should be able to see it in the "Drafts" section in the sidebar. Once you have opened the duplicate file, you can run the plugin.

To run the plugin, click on the "Plugins" menu and then click on "Razorsharp" and then click on "Run".
