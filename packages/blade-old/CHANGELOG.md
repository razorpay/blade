  **Updates**

  - Add `breakpoints` token to the themes.
  - Out of the box responsiveness support for typography tokens.
  - Publish `useBreakpoint` hook.
  - Following breakpoints are supported as of today.
    ```
    /** max width: 320px  */
    xs: 320;
    /** min width: 321px and max width: 480px */
    s: 480;
    /** min width: 481px and max width: 768px */
    m: 768;
    /** min width: 769 and max width: 1024px */
    l: 1024;
    /** min width: 1025 and max width: 1200px */
    xl: 1200;
    /** min width: 1201px  */
    max: 1201;
    ```
  - For web the typography scale will toggle between mobile and desktop
    - `xs, s, m` are considered as mobile
    - `l, xl, xl` are considered as desktop
  - For react native we always default to mobile typography scale

  **What does it mean for me(as a developer)?**

  - If youâ€™re already using Blade tokens then you can leverage this by just running `yarn upgrade @razorpay/blade@0.1.6` and thatâ€™s it you are set ðŸš€
    - You can use the typography tokens as you were doing previously. Refer the [usage guideline here](https://61c19ee8d3d282003ac1d81c-jukcfyruls.chromatic.com/?path=/story/guides-usage--page&globals=measureEnabled:false#tokens)
  - You can use these `breakpoints` as a base reference to build your next set of features by just following the [usage guidelines here](https://61c19ee8d3d282003ac1d81c-jukcfyruls.chromatic.com/?path=/story/tokens-breakpoints--page&globals=measureEnabled:false).

  This is our first step towards building responsive and adaptive applications. Weâ€™ll be publishing Typography Components next which will be built on top of these tokens and you can use them directly for your projects. Meanwhile, [read more about our responsive and adaptive strategy in this RFC](https://github.com/razorpay/blade/blob/master/rfcs/2022-02-11-responsive-and-adaptive-layout-strategy.md)

### Major Changes

- 617066a: feat(blade-old): improved icon API

  As discussed in [#363](https://github.com/razorpay/blade/issues/363) we had decided to move to a more flexible and open API for the icons,
  Instead of using a single Icon component and passing the name="" prop we will be directly using the icon by importing it.

  ### Changes in \<Icon />

  Icon component is now a generic wrapper to create new icons.
  To add new icons to blade's icon library you can use the <Icon /> component like so:

  ```jsx
  // User defined custom icons
  export const MyCustomIcon = (props) => {
    return (
      <Icon viewBox="0 0 24 24" {...props}>
        <path d="" />
      </Icon>
    );
  };

  // usage
  <Button icon={MyCustomIcon}>
  ```
