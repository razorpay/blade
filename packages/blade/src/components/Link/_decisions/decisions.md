## Design
[Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/file/jubmQL9Z8V7881ayUD95ps/Blade---Payment-Light?node-id=12699%3A147155) to the **Link** component


## Internal BaseLink Component
Internal component that exposes certain extra props to enable creation of Component Level Action Link like `positive`, `negative`, `neutral`, `information`, `notice`

### BaseLink API
| Prop | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| variant | `anchor`, `button` | *No* | `anchor` | The variant of the Link to be rendered.<br><br>Note: `button` will look like an inline Link component (no spacing; can be rendered alongside other text) but will be rendered as a `button` element. |
| intent |  `positive`,`negative`, `notice`, `information`, `neutral` | *No* | undefined | The intent of the link to be rendered.<br><br>  Note: <br> - We will use this to set the intent for internal Blade components that have positive, negative, notice, info, or neutral link buttons like an Alert component. |
| contrast | `low`, `high` | *No* | `low` | The contrast of the link to be rendered.<br><br>  Note: We need this for internal Blade components since a `positive` intent could have a `high` as well as a `low` contrast link. |
| children | `string` | When `icon` is passed: *No*<br>When `icon` is not passed: *Yes*   | undefined | The text to be rendered within the link. |
| icon | `Icon` | When `children` is passed: *No*<br>When `children` is not passed: *Yes* | undefined | The Blade `Icon` component to be rendered within the link. |
| iconPosition | `left`, `right` | *No* | `right` | The position of the rendered icon. |
| isDisabled | `boolean` | *No* | `false` | Control whether the link is disabled or not.<br><br>Note: This prop is only valid for `button` variant. |
| onClick | `Function` | No | undefined | The function to be called when the link is clicked. |
| href | `string` | No | undefined | The href for the link component.<br><br>Note: This prop is only valid for `anchor` variant. |
| target | `string` | No | undefined | The target for the link component.<br><br>Note: This prop is only valid for `anchor` variant. |
| rel | `string` | No | undefined | The rel for the link component.<br><br>Note: <br>- This prop is only valid for `anchor` variant.<br>-When `target` prop is set to `_blank`, `rel` will be automatically set to `noopener noreferrer` which can be overridden by passing the `rel` prop. |
| accessibilityLabel | `string` | No | undefined | The `aria-label` (web) & `accessibilityLabel` (native) of the link component. |


## Link Component
A Link component that can act as a `<button>` as well as an `<anchor>` element. This will be the component exported to the consumers. This is a wrapper on top of `BaseLink` component to avoid exposing `intent` & `contrast` to consumers.

### Link API

| Prop | Type | Required | Default | Description |

| variant | `anchor`, `button` | *No* | `anchor` | The variant of the Link to be rendered.<br><br>Note: `button` will look like an inline Link component (no spacing; can be rendered alongside other text) but will be rendered as a `button` element. |
| children | `string` | When `icon` is passed: *No*<br>When `icon` is not passed: *Yes*   | undefined | The text to be rendered within the link. |
| icon | `Icon` | When `children` is passed: *No*<br>When `children` is not passed: *Yes* | undefined | The Blade `Icon` component to be rendered within the link. |
| iconPosition | `left`, `right` | *No* | `right` | The position of the rendered icon. |
| isDisabled | `boolean` | *No* | `false` | Control whether the link is disabled or not.<br><br>Note: This prop is only valid for `button` variant. |
| onClick | `Function` | No | undefined | The function to be called when the link is clicked. |
| href | `string` | No | undefined | The href for the link component.<br><br>Note: This prop is only valid for `anchor` variant. |

## Component Breakdown

## Accessibility
- `role` will be `link` when variant is `anchor`
- `role` will be `button` when variant is `button`
- Accept `accessibilityLabel` from the consumer and set `aria-label` for web & `accessibilityLabel` for native
