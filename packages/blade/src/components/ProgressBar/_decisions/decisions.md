## Design
- [Figma - ProgressBar](https://www.figma.com/file/jubmQL9Z8V7881ayUD95ps/Blade---Payment-Light?node-id=16430%3A256423)


## API

| Prop | Type | Default | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| label | `string` | `undefined` | The label to be rendered with the progress bar. |  |
| value | number | `0` | The current progress value for the progress bar. |  |
| min | number | `0` | The minimum value for the progress bar. |  |
| max | number | `100` | The maximum value for the progress bar. |  |
| variant | `progress`, `meter` | `progress` | Controls the variant to be rendered. `progress` variant will be rendered as a dynamic progress bar whereas `meter` will be a static meter displaying the current value as meter component.   |
| contrast | `low`, `high` | `low` | The contrast of the progress bar to be rendered. |  |
| intent | `positive`,`negative`, `notice`, `information`, `neutral` | `undefined` | The intent of the progress bar to be rendered. | |
| size | `small`, `medium` | `small` | The size of the progress bar to be rendered. |  |
| accessibilityLabel | `string` | `undefined` | The accessibility label (aria-label) for the progress bar. |
| isIndeterminate | `boolean` | `false` | Control whether the progress bar is indeterminate or not. The progress bar will remain in an indeterminate state and respect the `isIndeterminate` prop if `isIndeterminate` is passed along with `value`. This prop will be ignored if `variant` is `meter`  |
| showPercentage | `boolean` | `true` | Control whether the progress bar should show the current progress percentage or not. Percentage would be automatically hidden when the progress bar is in an indeterminate state.  |


### Sample Usage
```jsx
import { ProgressBar } from '@razorpay/components';

<ProgressBar 
  variant='progress'
  label='Loading' 
  value={20} 
  contrast='low'
  size='large'
  accessibilityLabel='Loading Payments'
/>
```

### Accessibility
- We'll accept a prop `accessibilityLabel` which will be passed on as `aria-label` for web & `accessibilityLabel` for native to aide screen readers
- By default the value of `accessibilityLabel` will be the same as `label` prop.
- We will set `aria-role` as `progressbar` for `progress` variant (`accessibilityRole` for React Native)
- We will set `aria-role` as `meter` for `meter` variant (`accessibilityRole` for React Native)
- We will pass the value of `value` prop as `aria-valuenow` (`accessibilityValue` for React Native)
- We will set `aria-valuemin` as `min` (default as `0`)
- We will set `aria-valuemax` as `max` (default as `100`)
- We will set `aria-valuenow` as clamped `value` (If value passed is less than min, min would be used as the current value. If value passed is greater than max, max would be used as the current value)
- We will set `aria-valuetext` as clamped percentage `value` when variant is `progress` (`20` will be passed as `20%`)
- We will set `aria-valuetext` as clamped `value` when variant is `meter` (`20` will be passed as `20`)


## Handling pulsating animation
After `3000ms` the progress bar would start pulsating to indicate to the user that the process is slow but isn't stuck.
<img src="./progress-bar-pulse.gif" width="380" />

**Problem:**
- We have use-cases where a progress bar could be used:
  - <img src="./progress-bar-static.png" width="240" />

- In such cases, we wouldn't want the progress bar to pulsate after `3000ms` since this will remain static.

**Possible Solutions:**
1. Use prop `variant` as `'static'` and `'default' | 'animated'`

- Pros:
   - `variant` is a commonly used prop and makes it easy to understand that a different variation of the component exists

- Cons:
   - When the variant would be `static`, it won't entirely be static. When the `value` is changed, it will animate (easing with duration for filling the bar) to the new value. Only the pulsating animation would be disabled.
   - Education effort would be needed to communicate exactly what we mean by a static variant and where should it be used.

2. Use prop `animation` as `'none'` and `'default' | 'pulse'`

- Pros:
   - `animation` is more specific than `variant` since the only change would be related to animation.

- Cons:
  - When the animation would be `none`, it won't entirely be none. When the `value` is changed, it will animate (easing with duration for filling the bar) to the new value. Only the pulsating animation would be disabled.
  - Education effort would be needed to communicate exactly what we mean by animation as none, pulse (or default) and where should it be used.
  
3. Use prop `showPulsatingAnimation` as `boolean`

- Pros:
   - It would be a single-purpose boolean and is easy to understand what it does.

- Cons:
   - Could be slightly misleading since `showPulsatingAnimation={true}` will only show the animation after a default delay of `3000ms`. By its name, a consumer might confuse it to show the pulsating animation immediately and report this as a bug.

### Conclusion
- We will pass a prop `variant` that accepts `progress` or `meter` as values.
- A `meter` variant will not have the secondary animation
- Refer the next section about meter component for more details

## Meter & Progress Variants
- After discussing the use-case of a "static" progress bar, we realized that this is closer to a `meter` component than a `progress` component
- So we'll expose a prop `variant` which can be `progress` or `meter`
- `progress` will have primary fill animation as well as secondary pulsating animation
- `progress` will have accessibility attributes as per the [`progressbar` role](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#progressbar)
- `meter` will have only the primary fill animation
- `meter` will have accessibility attributes as per the [`meter` role](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#meter)

## Open Questions
- ~Why not medium instead of large progress bar?~ We'll be using `small` & `medium`
- ~What should be the default progress bar size?~ `small` will be the default size
- ~Animation for indeterminate state is pending from design~ Done
- ~Should we have an `animationSpeed` with values `slow`, `medium`, `fast` for indeterminate progress bars?
