## Design

- [Figma - Modal](https://www.figma.com/file/jubmQL9Z8V7881ayUD95ps/Blade---Payment-Light?type=design&node-id=35860-607833&t=hEZsxB4yG6A3Gmib-0)

## Anatomy
Modal's Anatomy is similar to BottomSheet's Anatomy and we will keep the API decisions consistent to that of BottomSheet. You can find more details on [BottomSheet's API decisions here](https://github.com/razorpay/blade/blob/master/packages/blade/src/components/BottomSheet/_decisions/decisions.md).

## API

Sample usage:

```jsx
import { Modal, ModalHeader, ModalBody, ModalFooter, Button, Text } from '@razorpay/blade/components';

const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

<Modal isOpen={isOpen} onDismiss={() => setIsOpen(false)}>
  <ModalHeader title="Modal Title" />
  <ModalBody>
    <Text>This is the Modal Body</Text>
  </ModalBody>
  <ModalFooter>
    <Button variant='secondary'>Cancel</Button>
    <Button variant='primary'>Save</Button>
  </ModalFooter>
</Modal>
```

### `Modal` API

| Prop               | Type                       | Default     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Required |

| onDismiss          | `Callback`                 | `undefined` | Called when the modal is closed, either by user state, hitting `esc` or tapping backdrop                                                                                                                                | ✅        |
| size               | `small`, `medium`, `large` | `small`     | Size of the modal. Each size corresponds to a max-width for the Modal. Each size will have a fixed min-width of `320px`. See the [Modal Sizes & Responsiveness](#modal-sizes--responsiveness) section for more details. |          |
| initialFocusRef    | `React.Ref`                | `undefined` | ref element you want to get keyboard focus when opening the modal                                                                                                                                                       |          |
| children           | `React.ReactNode`          | `undefined` | Accepts only Modal sub components like ModalHeader,ModalBody,ModalFooter                                                                                                                                                |          |
| accessibilityLabel | `string`                   | `undefined` | The accessibility label (aria-label) for the Modal.                                                                                                                                                                     |          |  |

#### Controlled State
- Modal will always be a controlled component which means that the consumer will have to pass the `isOpen` prop and handle the state of the Modal themselves. 
- Internally we will call `onDismiss` when the user toggles the `isOpen` prop to `false` or hits `esc` or taps on the backdrop or clicks on the close icon on the Modal Header.

### `ModalBody` API

| Prop       | Type                         | Default       | Description                | Required |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- | -------- |
| `children` | `React.ReactNode`            | `undefined`   | Content of the Modal       | ✅        |
| `padding`  | `'spacing.0'`, `'spacing.6`' | `'spacing.6'` | Padding for the Modal Body |          |

### `ModalHeader` API
> `ModalHeader` API will be similar to [`BottomSheetHeader` API](https://github.com/razorpay/blade/blob/master/packages/blade/src/components/BottomSheet/_decisions/decisions.md#bottomsheetheader-api) with the exception of `showBackButton` & `onBackButtonClick` props.

| Prop          | Type                                         | Default     | Description                                                                 | Required |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `title`       | `string`                                     | `undefined` | Title of the Header                                                         |          |
| `subtitle`    | `string`                                     | `undefined` | Subtitle of the Header                                                      |          |
| `leading`     | `React.ReactNode`                            | `undefined` | leading asset or icon to be placed at the left most side of the ModalHeader |          |
| `trailing`    | `Badge, Link, Text, IconButton`, `undefined` | undefined   | trailing component to be placed at the right most side of the ModalHeader   |          |
| `titleSuffix` | `Counter`                                    | `undefined` | A component to be placed adjacent to the title text                         |          |

### `ModalFooter` API
> `ModalFooter` API will be similar to [`BottomSheetFooter` API](https://github.com/razorpay/blade/blob/master/packages/blade/src/components/BottomSheet/_decisions/decisions.md#bottomsheetfooter-api).

| Prop       | Type              | Default     | Description                 | Required |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ----------- | --------------------------- | -------- |
| `children` | `React.ReactNode` | `undefined` | Contents of the ModalFooter | ✅        |

## Behaviors
### Modal Closing
- Modal can be closed by the user in 3 ways:
  - By clicking on the backdrop
  - By hitting the `esc` key
  - By clicking on the close icon on the Modal Header
- Each of these actions will call the `onDismiss` callback passed by the consumer.

### Modal Stacking
- We will be supporting stacking of Modals.
- As an initial implementation, we will have a basic stacking animation where the new Modal will have its own default entry and exit animation without affecting the existing Modal.
- As an enhancement post release, we will explore if we can have a more sophisticated stacking animation.


### Modal Sizes & Responsiveness

<img src="./modal-responsiveness.gif" alt="Modal Responsiveness POC" width="100%" />

- We will offer Modal in 3 sizes - small, medium and large.
- Each size corresponds to a `max-width` for the Modal
- As of today these are the max-widths we're using for each size:
  - small: `400px`
  - medium: `760px`
  - large: `1024px`
- All the Modals will have a `width` of `100vw - 32px` (16px gap on left & right sides) so that there is always a gap between the Modal and the viewport.
- All the sizes of Modals will have a `min-width` of `320px`.
  - This would mean that the Modal will be responsive and will scale down to `320px` on smaller screens but will not scale up beyond the max-width as per its size mentioned above.
- **POC Link**: https://codesandbox.io/s/eloquent-lalande-jvxwno
  - This POC showcases the responsive behavior of the Modal component.
  - We've tried 2 approaches with a combination of different `max-width` & `width` values.
  - Since both of the approaches seem to work as expected, we will implemented the first approach of having `max-width` control the size and a fixed `width` of `100vw - 32px` for all the sizes.

### Modal Height
- Each Modal will have a max-height of `80vh` (80% of viewport height) and will be scrollable if the content exceeds this height.
- If the height of the content is less than `80vh`, the Modal's height will be equal to the height of the content.


### Modal Usage on mWeb & native apps
- We will **not be exposing** the Modal component on **mWeb** or native apps (this is a design guideline) instead we would encourage our teams be use BottomSheet for mWeb and native apps.
- Even though usage on mWeb is discouraged by our design guideline, our Modal will be responsive and will not visually break till 320px on mWeb.
- We will throw a warning when a Modal is opened on smaller screens as well as add this to our documentation.
- Designers would need to be mindful of this while designing for mWeb and native apps.
- On Figma, we have added guardrails to ensure that when screenSize is selected Mobile on Figma, Modal component will turn into a BottomSheet component.
- We are **not automatically changing** our **Modal to BottomSheet** on code to avoid bundle size overhead as well as to avoid any flow to break unless mindfully implemented with BottomSheet on code.

#### Using BottomSheet on mWeb
- As per our design guideline, we will be using BottomSheet on mWeb for all the use-cases where we would have used Modal on dWeb.
- This would require our consumers to add some logic to handle this switch from Modal to BottomSheet on mWeb.
- This decision also enables our consumers to save on bundle size so that the mWeb's bundle only contains BottomSheet and the dWeb's bundle only contains Modal.


**Example usage:**

> You can use Lazy Loading to load the Modal component only on dWeb and BottomSheet component only on mWeb.

```jsx
import { useTheme, BottomSheet, Modal } from '@razorpay/blade';

const App = () => {
  const { theme, platform } = useTheme();

  return (
    <>
      {platform === 'onMobile' ? (
        <BottomSheet>
          <BottomSheetHeader />
          <BottomSheetBody>
            /* BottomSheetBody content */
          </BottomSheetBody>
          <BottomSheetFooter />
        </BottomSheet>
      ) : (
        <Modal>
          <ModalHeader />
          <ModalBody>
            /* ModalBody content */
          </ModalBody>
          <ModalFooter />
        </Modal>
      )}
    </>
  );
};
```


### Modal for React Native
- Since we want to restrict the usage of Modals on native apps, we will not be implementing the Modal component for React Native.
- We will implement a dummy export which will only warn the consumer that this component is not supported on native apps.
- We will also add this to our documentation.

## Accessibility
- Ref: https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/
- We will trap the keyboard focus within the Modal.
- We will close the modal when the user hits the `esc` key.
- We will expose `accessibilityLabel` prop
- We will set `aria-modal='true'` & `aria-role='dialog'`
- We will lock the page-scroll when the Modal is open
  - Further technical research will be done during implementation.
  - Ref: https://css-tricks.com/prevent-page-scrolling-when-a-modal-is-open/

## Open questions
- ~Do we need a different animation for Modal stacking?~ We will have a basic animation for Modal stacking.
- ~Do we need a back button on Modal Header?~ No, we do not.
