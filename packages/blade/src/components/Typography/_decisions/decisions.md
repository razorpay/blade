The text component is categorised into multiple parts

- BaseText - Internal Component, not published to consumers
- Title - Public Component
- Heading - Public Component
- Text - Public Component
- Code - Public Component

Here's how the hierarchy will looks like
![Component Breakdown](./component-breakdown.png)

The APIs for all the above component will look something like below

- `BaseText`

  This component is just meant to be used for internal purposes for Blade
  Here's how the API will look like

  ```jsx
  <BaseText
    color="surface.text | feedback.text | button.text"
    fontFamily="fontfamily.name"
    fontSize="fontSize.name"
    fontWeight="fontWeight.name"
    lineWeight="lineWeight"
    letterSpacing="letterSpacing"
    formatting="bold/italic/strike"
    as="h1-h6/p/span"
  />
  ```

- `Title`

  This component is meant to be used for Titles(bigger banner style kind of text) mostly on landing pages or page level headings.

  Title will internally use `BaseText` to render. We'll use native html heading tags to render title and native text element for react-native to render the Title.

  ```jsx
  <Title variant="small | medium | large" type="normal | subtle | subdued | muted | placeholder">
    Some Title
  </Title>
  ```

- `Heading`

  As the name indicates these will be used for headings on the page.

  Heading will internally use `BaseText` to render. Natively we'll use html heading tags for web and native text element for react-native to render the headings.

  ```jsx
  <Heading
    variant="small | medium | large | subheading"
    type="normal | subtle | subdued | muted | placeholder"
  >
    Some Heading
  </Heading>
  ```

- `Text`

  This component is the one that we'll use to render normal text on the screen(a.k.a as paragraphs or body text)

  Text will internally use `BaseText` to render. Natively we'll use html `<p></p>` tag for web and native `<Text></Text>` react-native to render the headings.

  ```jsx
  <Text
    variant=" medium | large | caption"
    weight="regular | bold"
    type="normal | subtle | subdued | muted | placeholder"
    shouldTruncate="true | false"
    numberOfLines="" // not yet finalised but might need for truncating on react-native
  >
    Some Text
  </Text>
  ```

- `Code`

  This component will be used to highlight code content in the paragraph. This not the actual code block component. the scope is to just highlight inline content which can refer code.

  Text will internally use `BaseText` to render. Natively we'll use html `<code></code>` tag for web and native `<Text></Text>` react-native to render the code text.

  ```jsx
  <Code variant="large | caption" type="normal | subtle | subdued | muted | placeholder">
    SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN:xyz
  </Code>
  ```
