## BaseInput API

The BaseInput is the underlying input field that will in turn be used to render all types of input. For now this will be an **internal component** and won't be exposed to consumers. We need this so we can have the rendering of text input and interactions at one central place but can restrict/add more control to consumer components based on their type.

## Keyboard return key types for web and Native

| Key Type            | Web                       | Native                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| <kbd>↵</kbd>        | `enterkeyhint="enter"`    | `returnKeyType="default"`                |
| <kbd>go</kbd>       | `enterkeyhint="go"`       | `returnKeyType="go"`                     |
| <kbd>Done</kbd>     | `enterkeyhint="done"`     | `returnKeyType="done"`                   |
| <kbd>Next</kbd>     | `enterkeyhint="next"`     | `returnKeyType="next"`                   |
| <kbd>Previous</kbd> | `enterkeyhint="previous"` | `returnKeyType="previous"`(android only) |
| <kbd>Search</kbd>   | `enterkeyhint="search"`   | `returnKeyType="search"`                 |
| <kbd>Send</kbd>     | `enterkeyhint="send"`     | `returnKeyType="send"`                   |

## Notes

Reusable components candidate

- label
- helpText/errorText/successText
- character counter(only input field)
- clear icon button
- prefix/suffix

## Open questions

- [ ] Do we need to expose `autoCapitalize` for native?
  - confirm once with mobile devs. design side we shall not touch this
- [ ] Do we need to expose `onSubmitEditing` for native?
- [ ] Do we need to fix the height for reserving space for help/error/success text?
  - Pending on design, Saurav to visually test this
- [x] Do we have icon which is clickable so we can put it under textfield?
  - We don't have need to create one
- [x] motion for the textfield animation in active state
- [x] Do we have a usecase of using textfield without label or form level things?
  - Not right now. we'll mark label as required field for now
- [x] fullWidth input field do we have a use case?
  - TextField will always be 100% width of the container
- [x] textContentType for autocomplete on native ios only
  - https://reactnative.dev/docs/textinput#textcontenttype-ios
  - added a prop `autofillSuggestionType` which will work cross platform
- [x] what is the default position for loader in loading state? following are some options

  - based on icon prop
  - based on clearbutton
  - leave this decision upto consumer
  - fix it either on left/right
  - **Conclusion**: fix it on right always. basically all the actionables for input field will always be on the right side(clear, showPassword)

- [x] Do we need leading and trailing both icons? or we shall just accept an `icon` prop and then decide the position internally?
  - **Conclusion**: We shall just accept `icon` prop and we'll always fix the position on the left internally. This will visually bring in consistency when multiple input fields are placed in one form.
- [x] Do we have a use case to show clear button in case of password field?
  - yes. the clear button will be shown before the show password button.
- [x] returnKeyType native - native
  - enterkeyhint - web
- [x] Do we need link? what is the use case?
  - NA
- [x] How to handle the view layout changes on mobile when the keyboard appears so the input doesn't moves out of the view
  - accept and pass ref
- [x] `textAlign` on native need to be exposed?
  - yes might be required for OTP
- [x] multiline error messages?
  - deferred for now until we have a use case for it
- [x] Do we need to show errorText/successText along with helpText or only one of them can be shown at a time?

  - only one at a time in the priority errorText > successText > helpText

- [x] `readonly` need to be supported? or just disabled? or both?

  - Using the disabled prop will prevent the text field from receive keyboard focus or inputs
  - The readOnly prop allows focus on the text field but prevents input or editing
  - We'll right now just go with disabled prop

- [x] labelAlignment - do we need to give this option? if no, then what is the default alignment when the position is left? -

  - always left aligned

- [x] do we need a trailingIconClick? what if we provide clear button and the onClick for that and then only have leading and trailing props which can accept text as well as icon?

  - added `showClearButton` prop along with `onClearButtonClick` handler

## Discussion Notes

### Actionables for Design based on discussions on 21-07-2022

- Action items from discussion(21-07-22)
- Add isLoading prop for the plain input field
- Rename leadingIcon to just icon and fix the position to the left
- Remove trailingIcon and update the docs
- Add clear button component
- Add a prop call showClearButton which will display clear button
- Add necessity indicator prop to all the input fields. if `optional` is provided then it'll show `${label} (optional)` and if `required` is provided then it'll show `${label} *`
- create prefix and suffix props for plain text field
- update docs for keyboard interaction for different input types for mobile. refer https://github.com/razorpay/blade/blob/feat/input-field/packages/blade/src/components/Input/_decisions/decisions.md#web--react-native-attributes-for-showing-keyboard-types-and-autocomplete-suggestions-based-on-input
- add autofillSuggestionType to docs to show how to guide browsers to show the correct autofill suggestions both on desktop and mobile platforms
- add validationState: none | error | success
- visually test if we want to reserve space for help/error/success text to avoid the layout content shift
