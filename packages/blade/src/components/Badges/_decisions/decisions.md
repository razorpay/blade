# Badge <!-- omit in toc -->
Badges are used to show small amount of color coded metadata, which are ideal for getting users attention.

|---|---|---|---|---|
| children | `string` | `undefined` | The label to be rendered within the badge. | âœ… |
| intent | `positive`,`negative`, `notice`, `information`, `neutral` | `neutral` | The intent of the badge to be rendered. |  |
| contrast | `low`, `high` | `low` | The contrast of the badge to be rendered. |  |
| size | `medium`, `small` | `medium` | The size of the badge to be rendered. |  |
| icon | `Icon` | `undefined` | The Blade `Icon` component to be rendered for the badge. |  |
| labelStyle | `italic`, `normal` | `normal` | The font style of the badge's label. |  |

### Sample Usage
```jsx
import { Badge } from '@razorpay/components';

<Badge 
  intent='positive'
  contrast='high'
  icon={InfoIcon} 
  size='large' 
  labelStyle='italic' 
  labelWeight='bold'
>
  New
</Badge>
```

## Open Questions
#### Dev
- Should we call it `labelWeight`, `labelStyle` or `fontWeight`, `fontStyle` or `textWeight`, `textStyle`?
- ~Should we call it `variant` or `intent`?~ Answered in a [section below](#intent-prop)
- What should be the default `variant`? Kept it as `neutral` for now since it seems more _neutral_ and appropriate
- Scope of A11y?
  - NA

#### Design
- Do we need badges where the text can overflow? Ref: [Mantine Badge](https://mantine.dev/core/badge/#full-width-and-overflow)
- Do we need to support icon only badges?
- Should we auto-capitalize label when `labelWeight` is bold?

## Discussions
### `intent` prop
> Note: This conversation was a rollercoaster. Read at your own risk.
- The team had a long discussion on how we want to control the _colors_ of the badge. 
- Badge offers 5 colors as of today - positive(green), negative(red), notice(yellow), information(blue), neutral(navy-blue)
- Since these colors map well with our feedback tokens and are similar to how `BaseButton`, `BaseLink` & `Alert` handle _colors_ our first instinct was to call this prop `intent` which accepts `positive`, `negative`, `notice`, `information`, & `neutral`
- On further discussion we realized that we would have use-cases in the near future where we would need to add support for more colors than the 5 mentioned above. At such a time, we would not be able to add another _intent_ as that would break the semantics of our feedback tokens since they are limited to `positive`, `negative`, `notice`, `information`, & `neutral`
- Considering this, we concluded that we cannot use `intent` as a prop to control the _color_ of the badge as it cannot scale to accommodate more colors.
- Another option we explored was to have a prop like `color` or `colorScheme` which could accept `red`, `green`, `yellow`, etc. This makes the prop scalable to accommodate more colors in the future.
- We then concluded that `variant` is a free-form prop and our consumers would be more accustomed to using `variant` to change certain aspects of the component, we realized that we could control the _color_ of Badge using the `variant` prop which would accept values from a list of design approved colors like `red`, `green`, `yellow`, `blue`, `navy-blue`, etc.
- This logic broke when we realized that the `neutral` (navy-blue) badge would need to be of the color navy-blue on Payment theme but would need to be white on Banking theme. This meant that we would need to use some form of semantic aliases to name these _variants_ of badge. 
- Which brought us back to conclusion that the prop `intent` makes the most sense. We'll Accept a prop called `intent` that has the values `positive`, `negative`, `information`, `notice`, `neutral`. These will be mapped to our feedback tokens and if in the future, more use-cases pop in for more colors we would need to add more values to our feedback tokens in a semantic (a name something that makes sense) or a non-semantic(a name that feels out of place) way.
- We noticed Spectrum had done something similar where they accept [Semantic](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/storybook/?path=/story/badge--semantic) and [Non-Semantic](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/storybook/?path=/story/badge--non-semantic) variants for their badge.
