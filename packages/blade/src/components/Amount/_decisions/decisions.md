## Open Questions

#### Dev

- ~~Should we call it `variant` or `intent`, `isStyled` or something more apt?~~
- ~~Should we separate the amount with commas based on the Indian currency format?~~
- ~~What should be the default `intent`? Kept it as `default` for now, but `neutral` seems more apt.~~
- ~~We currently use amount value in paise in backend, so how should we convert it to rupee here?~~

## Discussions

### Do we need to support more currency types?

- We concluded to have 'INR' as a primary currency for now, and enable other currencies in further versions.

### How do we sync the sizes with the different typography?

- After consideration we finalized to use this format variant-fontSize-fontWeight. This will make sure that we are in sync with different typography and not come under impossible states.

### Should we call `isSuffixPrefixHighlighted` or `isHighlighted` or `isAffixSubtle`, considering when this value is true the value will be highligted and not the affix.

- After careful consideration, we decided to name this property `isAffixSubtle`. This decision was reached based on the fact that the property controls the behavior of the affix, which in turn affects the visual appearance of the prefix and decimal digits. By setting this property to 'true', the affix will appear smaller and more faded.

### Should we have a seperate prop for decimals and another for affix symbols?

- We initially considered using two different props, but then realized that only one of them would be shown at a time. So in that case, we decided to use a single prop called 'suffix'. We ultimately settled on using a prop with three possible values: 'none', 'decimals', and 'humanize'.

### Should we call `weight` or `fontWeight`?

- We decided to call it `weight` as this represents the weight of the amount component with the affix changing accordingly. This also follows the same convention as other components.
- Eventually we removed this prop as size prop will give weight too

### Should we separate the amount with commas based on the Indian currency format?

- Yes, we will be doing this for INR as well as other currencies.

### Scope of A11y?

- Accessibility considerations for a currency component would include assigning it the role of text, and using an aria-label attribute with a value such as 'Total value in INR: ₹1,23,456' to provide a label for the component.
