## Design
- [Figma - Spinner](https://www.figma.com/file/jubmQL9Z8V7881ayUD95ps/Blade---Payment-Light?node-id=14825%3A203592)


## BaseSpinner
A BaseSpinner will contain some extra props like `intent`. This will not be exposed to the consumer and will only be used for internal components.

### API

| Prop | Type | Default | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| accessibilityLabel | `string` | `undefined` | The accessibility label (aria-label) for the spinner. | âœ… |
| intent | `positive`,`negative`, `notice`, `information`, `neutral` | `undefined` | The intent of the spinner to be rendered. |  |
| contrast | `low`, `high` | `low` | The contrast of the spinner to be rendered. |  |
| size | `small`, `medium`, `large` | `medium` | The size of the spinner to be rendered. |  |
| label | `string` | `undefined` | The label of the spinner to be rendered. |  |
| labelPosition | `right`, `bottom` | `right` | The position of the rendered label. |  |


## Spinner
A wrapper around Spinner which will be exposed to the consumer to be used as a Spinner. This component will not allow passing `intent` to the Spinner.

### API

| Prop | Type | Default | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| accessibilityLabel | `string` | `"Loading"` | The accessibility label (aria-label) for the spinner. |
| contrast | `low`, `high` | `low` | The contrast of the spinner to be rendered. |  |
| size | `small`, `medium`, `large` | `medium` | The size of the spinner to be rendered. |  |
| label | `string` | `undefined` | The label of the spinner to be rendered. |  |
| labelPosition | `right`, `bottom` | `right` | The position of the rendered label. |  |


### Sample Usage
```jsx
import { Spinner } from '@razorpay/components';

<Spinner
  contrast='high'
  size='large' 
  accessibilityLabel='Loading'
/>
```

### Accessibility
- We'll accept a prop `accessibilityLabel` which will be passed on as `aria-label` for web & `accessibilityLabel` for native to aide screen readers
- By default the value of `accessibilityLabel` will be `Loading` and can be overwritten with something more meaningful by the consumer
- We will also set `aria-live` as `assertive` to inform a user with a screen-reader that something is loading


## Open Questions
- ~Should we set `aria-role` as `alert` for accessibility? [Carbon DS](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/loading/accessibility#how-it-works) does this as well.~ We'll be setting the `aria-role` as `progressbar`
