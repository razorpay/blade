## Design
[Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/file/jubmQL9Z8V7881ayUD95ps/Blade---Payment-Light?node-id=5200%3A0) to all variants of the Button component

## Internal BaseButton Component
Internal component that exposes certain extra props to enable creation of Component Level Action Buttons like `positive`, `negative`, `neutral`

### BaseButton API

| Prop | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| variant | `primary`,  `secondary`,  `tertiary`,  `link` | No | `primary` | - The variant of the button to be rendered.<br><br>Note: `link` will look like an inline Link component but will be rendered as a `button` element |
| intent | `positive`,`negative`, `notice`, `info`, `neutral` | No | undefined | The intent of the button to be rendered.<br><br>  Note: <br> - We will use this to set the intent for internal Blade components that have positive, negative, notice, info, or neutral buttons like an Alert component<br> - All the variants of the button will not be using any intent since it would only be required for internal components. |
| contrast | `low`, `high` | No | `low` | The contrast of the button to be rendered.<br><br>  Note: We need this for internal Blade components since a `positive` intent could have a `high` as well as a `low` contrast button |
| size | `large`, `medium`, `small`, `xsmall` | No | `medium` | The size of the button to be rendered. |
| children | `string` | No | undefined | The text to be rendered within the button. |
| icon | `Icon` | No | undefined | The Blade `Icon` component to be rendered within the button. |
| iconPosition | `left`, `right` | No | `right` | The position of the rendered icon. |
| isDisabled | `boolean` | No | `false` | Control whether the button is disabled or not. |
| isFullWidth | `boolean` | No | `false` | Allows the button to take up the full width of its parent. |
| onClick | `Function` | No | undefined | The function to be called when the button is clicked. |
| type | `button`, `submit`, `reset` | No | `button` | Specifies the type of button to be rendered.<br><br>  Note: This prop will be ignored for React Native |

## Button Component
This will be the Button component that is exposed to our consumers and will be a wrapper on top of `BaseButton` component

### Button API

| Prop | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| variant | `primary`,  `secondary`,  `tertiary`,  `link` | No | `primary` | - The variant of the button to be rendered.<br><br>Note: `link` will look like an inline Link component but will be rendered as a `button` element |
| size | `large`, `medium`, `small`, `xsmall` | No | `medium` | The size of the button to be rendered. |
| children | `string` | No | undefined | The text to be rendered within the button. |
| icon | `Icon` | No | undefined | The Blade `Icon` component to be rendered within the button. |
| iconPosition | `left`, `right` | No | `right` | The position of the rendered icon. |
| isDisabled | `boolean` | No | `false` | Control whether the button is disabled or not. |
| isFullWidth | `boolean` | No | `false` | Allows the button to take up the full width of its parent. |
| onClick | `Function` | No | undefined | The function to be called when the button is clicked. |

- **Why are we not exposing `contrast` prop for the `Button` Component?** 
   The Button component will only have a `variant` prop that would allow you to choose the kind of button you want. `contrast` is only required when we are using it along with `intent` for *internal* Blade components like an `Alert` that could have a `low` as well as `high` contrast positive-intent button. Our assumption is that our products will not require a standalone low-contrast-positive-button (except a couple edge cases where we would encourage using custom buttons). We're doing this to ensure these different combinations of buttons don't get over-used within our products leading to breakage in the design language. But the fact that we have these capabilities built in the `BaseButton` itself would ensure that *we can* expose these to our consumers when we see a massive demand for it.

## Open Questions
- ~Should we have `variant+contrast` props or `variant+action+contrast` props?~ We will go ahead with `variant+intent+contrast` props for now.
- ~What about small/large screen?~ This would be handled internally
- ~Component-level Actions look mostly like primary except Focus, what do we do?~ This was a Figma issue, it is intended to look exactly like the `primary` variant
- ~Should Plain/Link behave as `<a>` tag?~ We will have a `Link` variant but that would also be a `button`. We would have another `Link` component that will be an `<a>` tag. We do this to maintain the correct roles for button & link components.
- ~Should we expose a `type` prop for `button`, `reset`, `submit`?~ Yes, we should.
- ~Do we need `leadingIcon`/`leftIcon` `trailingIcon`/`rightIcon` props?~ Yes, we do. We'll control this with an `icon` & `iconPosition` prop.
- ~Should we call it onClick or onPress?~ We will call it onClick for more developer familiarity.
