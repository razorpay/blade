   * `base` is used for responsive styling following a **mobile first** approach. It starts from 0px till the next existing token
   *
   * Think of this as styles without any media query.
   *
   * ### Example
   *
   * This code will set margin as `spacing.2` on "m" size screens and above. And as `spacing.1` on less than "m" size screens
   * ```jsx
   * <Box margin={{ base: 'spacing.1', m: 'spacing.2' }} />
   * ```
   *
   * This roughly translates into -
   *
   * ```
   * .Box {
   *  margin: 'spacing.1';
   * }
   *
   * ï¼ media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
   *  .Box {
   *    margin: 'spacing.2';
   *  }
   * }
   * ```

   *
   * Dimensions with `m` and above can be treated as desktop in mobile-first approach (with min-width).
   * Hence this breakpoint can be used for desktop styling.
   *
   * E.g. next example will keep flexDirection `row` on mobiles and `column` on large tablets, desktop, and larger screens
   *
   * ```jsx
   * <Box display="flex" flexDirection={{ base: 'row', m: 'column' }} />
   * ```
