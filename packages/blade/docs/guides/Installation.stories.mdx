* Run `code ~/.bashrc` or `code ~/.zshrc` in your editor and add this line 
  ```

  ```
  >Note: Replace `<YOUR_TOKEN>` with your actual GitHub Personal Access Token
* Run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` based on the file you added your token.
* Run `code ~/.npmrc` and append the following
```bash
# add following to your .npmrc
@razorpay:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
