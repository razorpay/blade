<br />

## ‚úçüèª Pre-requisite

Before you install the package, make sure that you have performed following steps:

- You must be running Node version >=14.0.0
- You must have `yarn` installed
- Generate a Personal Access Token on GitHub by [visiting this link](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,workflow,write:packages,read:repo_hook,write:packages)
  - If you belong to razorpay organisation then you will need to enable SSO by clicking `Authorize` button next to Razorpay logo.
- Run `code ~/.bashrc` or `code ~/.zshrc` in your editor and add this line
  ```
  export GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN="<YOUR_TOKEN>"
  ```
  > Note: Replace `<YOUR_TOKEN>` with your actual GitHub Personal Access Token
- Run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` based on the file you added your token.
- Run `code ~/.npmrc` and append the following

```bash
# add following to your .npmrc
@razorpay:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
//npm.pkg.github.com/:always-auth=true
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN}
```

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Add blade to your application

1. Install blade as a dependency. Blade has a peer dependency on `styled-components`, you can skip adding it if you already have it installed in your project.

```shell
yarn add @razorpay/blade styled-components
```

2. Follow [this guide](#-install-fonts) to install the fonts.
3. For **React Native** projects, follow [this guide](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/installation) to support `react-native-reanimated` on Android & iOS which is required by Blade.
4. For **React Native** projects, follow [this guide](https://github.com/react-native-svg/react-native-svg#with-react-native-cli) to support `react-native-svg` on Android & iOS which is required by Blade.

## üî° Install Fonts

We are using `Lato` font family which is not a system font so we need to perform some additional steps to download, install and configure it.

### Web Projects

For web projects we can either use google fonts or self hosted fonts. Self hosted fonts have certain benefits that you can find [here](https://fontsource.org/docs/introduction)

#### Self Hosted(Recommended)

We recommend to use self hosted fonts. We'll use [Fontsource](https://fontsource.org/) which provides fonts as npm packages.

- Install `Lato` font
  ```shell
  yarn add @fontsource/lato
  ```
- Import within your app entry file(eg: `App.tsx`, `entryBrowser.tsx` etc.).
  ```js
  import '@fontsource/lato/400.css';
  import '@fontsource/lato/700.css';
  ```

#### Google Fonts

There are downsides to using google fonts which can be found [here](https://fontsource.org/docs/introduction) but still for some reason if you have some use case where google fonts makes more sense then you can [click this link](https://fonts.google.com/share?selection.family=Lato:wght@400;700) and follow the instructions there to configure `Lato` for your applications.

### React Native Projects

- Download `Lato` font from [here](https://fonts.google.com/share?selection.family=Lato:wght@400;700)
- Copy the font files and paste it under the directory `<project_root>/public/fonts`(**create the directory if it doesn't exist**)
- Create React Native config file at the root of your project - `<project_root>/react-native.config.js` and add following content to it
  ```js
  module.exports = {
    // ... rest of the config
    assets: ['./public/fonts/'],
  };
  ```

#### android

Follow the next steps mentioned below for configuring fonts to work on android:

- Create a directory `font` under `/android/app/src/main/res/font`
- Copy the font files `Lato-Regular` and `Lato-Bold` you had downloaded earlier and paste them under `/android/app/src/main/res/font`
- Rename the font files ~~`Lato-Regular.ttf`~~ ‚û°Ô∏è `lato_regular.ttf` and ~~`Lato-Bold.ttf`~~ ‚û°Ô∏è`lato_bold.ttf`(**mind the casing and underscores**).
- Create a file `lato.xml` under `/android/app/src/main/res/font/lato.xml` and copy the following contents to it
  ```xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <font-family xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto">
    <font app:fontStyle="normal" app:fontWeight="400" app:font="@font/lato_regular"/>
    <font app:fontStyle="normal" app:fontWeight="700" app:font="@font/lato_bold" />
  </font-family>
  ```
- Navigate to `/android/app/src/main/java/com/<your_package_name>/MainApplication.java` and add following contents to it
  ```java
  // add the below import statement after all the import statements
  import com.facebook.react.views.text.ReactFontManager;
  ```
  Now search for `onCreate` method and add the following line to it
  ```java
  public void onCreate() {
    // add below line as the first line
    ReactFontManager.getInstance().addCustomFont(this, "Lato", R.font.lato);
    // rest of the content of the method
  }
  ```

#### iOS

Follow the next steps mentioned below for configuring fonts to work on iOS:

- Once you've copied the font files under `<project_root>/public/fonts` you need to link it using following command
  ```shell
  npx react-native link --platform ios
  ```
