## ‚úçüèª Pre-requisite

Before you install the package, make sure that you have performed the following steps:

- You must be running Node version >=14.19.0

<details>
<summary>Razorpay Employees have to point @razorpay scope to GitHub Package Registry. Follow the steps below</summary>

- Generate a Personal Access Token on GitHub by [visiting this link](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,workflow,write:packages,read:repo_hook,write:packages) (Enable SSO by clicking `Authorize` button next to Razorpay logo.)
- Run `code ~/.bashrc` or `code ~/.zshrc` in your editor and add this line

  ```
  export GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN="<YOUR_TO  KEN>"
  ```

  > **Note**
  >
  > Replace `<YOUR_TOKEN>` with your actual GitHub Personal Access Token

- Run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` based on the file you added your token.
- Run `code ~/.npmrc` and append the following
  ```bash
  # add following to your .npmrc
  @razorpay:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
  //npm.pkg.github.com/:always-auth=true
  //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN}
  ```

## ‚¨á Add blade to your application

1. Install blade as a dependency.
   Blade has a peer dependency on a few libraries, you can skip adding it if you already have it installed in your project.

```shell
yarn add @razorpay/blade styled-components@5.3.11 @razorpay/i18nify-js @razorpay/i18nify-react
```

- `styled-components`
  > **Note**
  >
  > Currently, blade only supports styled-components v5 only
- `@razorpay/i18nify-js`
  - Blade uses this library for formatting capabilities in [Amount](https://blade.razorpay.com/?path=/docs/components-amount--docs) and other components based on the locale. Follow [this guide](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@razorpay/i18nify-js) to install it.
- `@razorpay/i18nify-react`
  - A state management React wrapper for `@razorpay/i18nify-js` that maintains locale state of your page. Follow [this guide](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@razorpay/i18nify-react) to configure and install it.

2. Follow [this guide](#-install-fonts) to install the fonts.

3. For **React Native** projects you need to do additional setup for the peer dependencies:

```shell
yarn add @floating-ui/react-native@0.10.0 react-native-reanimated@3.4.1 react-native-tab-view@3.5.2 react-native-pager-view@6.2.1 react-native-svg@12.3.0 react-native-gesture-handler@2.9.0 @gorhom/bottom-sheet@4.4.6 @gorhom/portal@1.0.1
```

- `react-native-reanimated`
  - Follow [this guide](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/installation) to install it on Android & iOS which is required by Blade.
- `react-native-svg`
  - Follow [this guide](https://github.com/react-native-svg/react-native-svg#with-react-native-cli) to install it on Android & iOS which is required by Blade.
- `react-native-gesture-handler`
  - Follow [this guide](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/installation) to install it, note that you don't need to add `<GestureHandlerRootView style={{ flex: 1 }}>` again on the root because BladeProvider already adds that out of the box.
- `@gorhom/bottom-sheet`
  - Add this as peer dependency, no need to do additional setup since BladeProvider already sets everything up.
- `@gorhom/portal`
  - Add this as peer dependency, no need to do additional setup since BladeProvider already sets everything up.
- `@floating-ui/react-native`
  - Add this as peer dependency, no need to do additional setup.
- `react-native-tab-view`
  - Add this as peer dependency, no need to do additional setup. This is needed for react-native Tabs component as per [this guide](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/tab-view/#installation).
- `react-native-pager-view`
  - Add this as peer dependency, no need to do additional setup. This is needed for react-native Tabs component as per [this guide](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/tab-view/#installation).

And finally run `pod install` command so that blade's RN dependencies are linked to your project:

```shell
 cd ios && pod install
```

## üî° Installing Fonts

We use 2 fonts. [TASA Orbiter](https://tasatype.localremote.co/) (for our headings), and [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) (for other text elements).

### Web Projects

- To add these fonts to your project, you can import them from blade package in your root entry file.

  ```ts
  // Somewhere in root index.ts or entryBrowser.tsx file
  import '@razorpay/blade/fonts.css';
  ```

- While Blade handles setting font-family for its own components, you can set font-family globally as well in your global styles for any custom components or exceptions

  ```ts
  import { createGlobalStyle } from 'styled-components';

  const GlobalStyles = createGlobalStyle`
  * { 
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }
  
  body {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    font-family: ${(props) => props.theme.typography.fonts.family.text}
  }
  
  h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
    font-family: ${(props) => props.theme.typography.fonts.family.heading};
  }
  `;
  ```

### React Native Projects

- Download fonts from <a href="https://github.com/razorpay/blade/tree/master/packages/blade/fonts/blade-fonts-react-native.zip">blade-fonts-react-native.zip</a> and unzip.

- #### For iOS

  - Copy all font files from the `ios-fonts` directory to `<project_root>/public/fonts` (**create the directory if it doesn't exist**)
  - Create a React Native config file at the root of your project - `<project_root>/react-native.config.js` and add the following content to it

    ```js
    module.exports = {
      // ... rest of the config
      assets: ['./public/fonts/'],
    };
    ```

  - Run the following command to link fonts in ios

    ```shell
    npx react-native-asset -ios-a
    ```

- #### For Android

  - Copy all files from `android-fonts` to `/android/app/src/main/res/font`
  - Navigate to `/android/app/src/main/java/com/<your_package_name>/MainApplication.java` and add the following contents to it

    ```js
    // add the below import statement after all the import statements
    import com.facebook.react.views.text.ReactFontManager;
    ```

  - Now search for `onCreate` method and add the following line to it

    ```js
    public void onCreate() {
      // add the below lines as the first lines
      ReactFontManager.getInstance().addCustomFont(this, "Inter", R.font.inter);
      ReactFontManager.getInstance().addCustomFont(this, "TASA Orbiter Display", R.font.tasa);
      // rest of the content of the method
    }
    ```
