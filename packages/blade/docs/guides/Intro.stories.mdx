## 📦 Packages

Blade has 2 packages

### [@razorpay/blade](https://github.com/razorpay/blade/tree/master/packages/blade)

This package is under **active development**. We'll only refer to this version of blade throughout this documentation.

### [@razorpay/blade-old](https://github.com/razorpay/blade-old#--blade-old)

This package is under **maintenance** and it won't have any major releases. It will be **deprecated** once the newer version (`@razorpay/blade`) is ready for a stable release. The repository is private and only accessible to Razorpay Employees. Documentation for this package can be found [here](https://github.com/razorpay/blade-old#--blade-old)

## 📝 Versioning & Publishing

- The first step in publishing a new version of blade is to first the mention the type of change and bump the version. We are using [`changesets`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets) to handle automated versioning for us based on the intent of the change we mention in the PR.
- Once a PR is approved by the authors of blade, based on if the PR needs a new version to be published the author will add a changeset to the PR.
- After the `changeset` is added and the PR is merged the `release` workflow gets triggered by GitHub actions.
- The `release` workflow runs `build` script which runs rollup to bundle `blade` and generates relevant `types` as well.
- After the build script finishes, we'll have 3 bundles which will be published under `@razorpay/blade` scope

```
@razorpay/blade/components
@razorpay/blade/tokens
