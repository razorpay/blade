## Editor Setup

- Make sure you have [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) installed and setup on your VSCode. This will guide you and autofix errors to keep the code consistent with this project's guidelines
- Make sure you have [VSCode MDX](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JounQin.vscode-mdx) installed on your VSCode. This will help you with linting the markdown files if you're modifying or adding any `mdx` files for documentation purpose.
  - After installing this plugin navigate to your settings and add `mdx` extension to your `eslint` config. Below is how your settings will look after configuring `mdx` to work with eslint
  ```json
  // .vscode/settings.json
  {
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
      "source.fixAll.eslint": true
    },
    "eslint.options": {
      "extensions": [".js", ".jsx", ".md", ".mdx", ".ts", ".tsx"]
    },
    "eslint.validate": [
      "markdown",
      "mdx",
      "javascript",
      "javascriptreact",
      "typescript",
      "typescriptreact"
    ]
  }
  ```

## Running Tests

We use `react-testing-library` for writing tests. If you want to write platform specific tests then suffix the test file with `filename.native.ts` or `filename.web.ts`

- To run the tests for react web projects follow the steps below:
  ```shell
  cd packages/blade
  yarn test:react
  ```
- To run the tests for react-native projects follow the steps below:
  ```shell
  cd packages/blade
  yarn test:react-native
  ```
> To update the snapshots run the test commands with `-u` as suffix

## Troubleshooting
* `Blade requires "FRAMEWORK" environment variable to be set. Valid values are "REACT" and "REACT_NATIVE". Instead, received: undefined`

  **Issue:** This is an issue that happens mostly if you run `yarn android` directly. For some reason `FRAMEWORK` doesn't gets passed to React Native application

  **Fix:** If you come across this issue then you first run `yarn start` and then run `yarn android`.
