## Testing Local Changes
We have all the examples under `packages/examples` directory. To run any example project with the updated changes follow the steps below:

1. Setup the example project
    ```shell
    cd packages/examples/<example-name>
    # install dependencies
    yarn
    ```

2. Publish the blade package with your changes using [`yalc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yalc).
    ```shell
    # run this from packages/blade directory
    npx yalc publish
    ```

3. Install the updated `blade` package using [`yalc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yalc).
    ```shell
    # run this from packages/examples/<example-name> directory
    npx yalc add @razorpay/blade
    ```

4. Run the example project and verify the changes
    ```shell
    # this script can vary based on the kind of project so check the example `package.json` to find the relevant script to start the project
    yarn start
    ```

## Running Tests
We use `react-testing-library` for writing tests. If you want to write platform specific tests then suffix the test file with `filename.native.ts` or `filename.web.ts`

* To run the tests for web projects follow the steps below:
  ```shell
  cd packages/blade
  yarn test:web
  ```
* To run the tests for native projects follow the steps below:
  ```shell
  cd packages/blade
  yarn test:native
  ```
> To update the snapshots run the test commands with `-u` as suffix
