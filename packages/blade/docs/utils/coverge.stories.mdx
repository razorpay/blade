# Blade Coverage Utils

Blade coverage measures the percentage of a page built with Blade. It does so by calculating the DOM nodes built with Blade vs Non-Blade. All the apps within Razorpay org that are using Blade have the coverage script integrated and you can check the coverage for your app on Amplitude. [Blade Coverage Dashboard](https://app.amplitude.com/analytics/razorpay-mobile/dashboard/texx2y4).

You can utilize the following utils to measure the coverage in different stages of your app development workflow.

> These functions are designed for web applications and should be used in a browser environment.

## `assertBladeCoverage`

This utility function asserts that the calculated blade coverage meets a specified threshold.

Parameters:
- **`page`:** Playwright page object.
- **`expect`:** The `expect` function from `@playwright/test`.
- **`threshold` (optional):** Minimum threshold for blade coverage (default is 70).

### Usage

- Ensure that you are using Blade v10.22.0 or above and playwright is properly set up.
- Import and use `assertBladeCoverage` in your test files. Adjust the threshold based on your coverage requirements.

  ```js dark
  import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
  import { assertBladeCoverage } from '@razorpay/blade/coverageUtils';

  test.describe.parallel('Test Home @flow=home', () => {
    test('should have blade coverage more than 70% @priority=normal', async ({ page }) => {
      await page.goto('/');

      await assertBladeCoverage({ page, expect, threshold: 70 });
    });
  });
  ```

- Execute your tests using the Playwright Test runner.
  
  ```bash dark
  npx playwright test
  ```

- Once your tests are passing and blade coverage is meeting expectations, you're good to go!

## `getBladeCoverage`

> Consider installing the [Blade Coverage Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/blade-coverage-extension/cpmmcebielcknjffelmpbcbgkcjapipp). This extension provides a convenient way to visualize and analyze the blade coverage directly in the Chrome browser. We internally use the below utility function.

This utility function calculates the blade usage coverage in percentage of the DOM elements on a web page.

```js dark
import { getBladeCoverage } from '@razorpay/blade/coverageUtils';

const { bladeCoverage, totalNodes, bladeNodes } = getBladeCoverage();
```

- **`bladeCoverage`:** The percentage of blade nodes in the total nodes.
- **`totalNodes`:** Total number of DOM nodes.
- **`bladeNodes`:** Number of blade nodes.
