## `assertBladeCoverage`

This utility function asserts that the calculated blade coverage meets a specified threshold.

Parameters:
- **`page`:** Playwright page object.
- **`expect`:** The `expect` function from `@playwright/test`.
- **`threshold` (optional):** Minimum threshold for blade coverage (default is 70).

### Usage

- Ensure that you are using Blade v10.22.0 or above and playwright is properly set up.
- Import and use `assertBladeCoverage` in your test files. Adjust the threshold based on your coverage requirements.

  ```js dark
  import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
  import { assertBladeCoverage } from '@razorpay/blade/coverage';

  test.describe.parallel('Test Home @flow=home', () => {
    test('should have blade coverage more than 70% @priority=normal', async ({ page }) => {
      await page.goto('/');

      await assertBladeCoverage({ page, expect, threshold: 70 });
    });
  });
  ```

- Execute your tests using the Playwright Test runner.
  
  ```bash dark
  npx playwright test
  ```

- Once your tests are passing and blade coverage is meeting expectations, you're good to go!

## `getBladeCoverage`

> Consider installing the [Blade Coverage Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/blade-coverage-extension/cpmmcebielcknjffelmpbcbgkcjapipp). This extension provides a convenient way to visualize and analyze the blade coverage directly in the Chrome browser.

This utility function calculates the blade usage coverage in percentage of the DOM elements on a web page.

```js dark
import { getBladeCoverage } from '@razorpay/blade/coverage';

const { bladeCoverage, totalNodes, bladeNodes } = getBladeCoverage();
```

- **`bladeCoverage`:** The percentage of blade nodes in the total nodes.
- **`totalNodes`:** Total number of DOM nodes.
- **`bladeNodes`:** Number of blade nodes.
