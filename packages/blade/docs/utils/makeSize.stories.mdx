## `makeSize`

`makeSize` converts any numerical unit into `px` units for both web and react native.
This was created with the purpose of having a utility that appends units to our size values.

For example `makeSize(10)` will return `10px` for web as well as react native.

```tsx
const makeSize = (size: number) => string;
```

### Example

```tsx
import { makeSize } from '@razorpay/blade/utils';
import styled from 'styled-components';

const CustomComponent = styled.div`
  height: ${makeSize(512)}; // '512px'
  width: ${makeSize(256)}; // '256px'
`;
```
