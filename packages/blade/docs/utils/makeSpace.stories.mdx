## `makeSpace`

Spacing tokens in our theme are stored as plain numbers but they need to be converted into px units before we can use them.
`makeSpace` converts spacing tokens into `px` units for web as well as react native.

For example, `makeSpace(10)` will return `10px` for web as well as react native.

> Should be used only with Blade's [Spacing tokens](?path=/story/tokens-spacing--docs)

```tsx
const makeSpace = (size: number) => string;
```

### Example

```tsx
import { makeSpace } from '@razorpay/blade/utils';
import styled from 'styled-components';

const CustomComponent = styled.div`
  padding: ${({ theme }) => makeSpace(theme.spacing[2])}; // 4px
`;
```
