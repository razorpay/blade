# CodeBlock

CodeBlock is a component used to display and highlight code snippets with proper syntax highlighting. It automatically adapts to the current theme (light or dark) using GitHub-like syntax highlighting colors.

## Overview

The CodeBlock component provides a clean and readable way to present code snippets in your application. It currently supports the following languages:

- JSON
- Protobuf

CodeBlock automatically applies syntax highlighting based on the language specified, making it easier for users to read and understand the code.

## Features

- GitHub-like syntax highlighting
- Theme adaptation (light/dark mode)
- Support for JSON and Protobuf languages
- Configurable background display
- Clean, readable code formatting

## Props

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| children | string | - | The code content to display and highlight |
| lang | 'json' \| 'protobuf' | 'json' | The language for syntax highlighting |
| showBackground | boolean | true | Whether to show a background color |
| testID | string | - | Test ID for testing frameworks |

## Theme Support

CodeBlock automatically adapts to the current theme (light or dark) using the Blade design system's theme variables. The syntax highlighting colors are derived from GitHub-like color schemes:

- **Light Theme**: 
  - Uses GitHub's light syntax highlighting colors for a clean, readable appearance
  - Background color is pure white (#ffffff) to match GitHub's code display
  - Property names and numbers are blue (#0550ae)
  - Strings are dark blue (#0a3069)
  - Keywords (true, false, null) are red (#cf222e)
  - Comments are gray (#6e7781)

- **Dark Theme**: 
  - Uses GitHub's dark syntax highlighting colors for reduced eye strain in dark environments
  - Background color is GitHub's dark mode code background (#0d1117)
  - Property names and numbers are light blue (#75beff)
  - Strings are light blue (#a5d6ff)
  - Keywords are red-orange (#ff7b72)
  - Comments are muted gray (#8b949e)

## Guidelines

- Use CodeBlock when you need to present code snippets to users
- Always provide meaningful and properly formatted code for better readability
- Consider using the `showBackground` prop to visually separate the code from surrounding content
- Ensure the code is syntactically correct for the selected language
- For long code snippets, consider using CodeBlock within a scrollable container
