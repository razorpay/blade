# Bi-Weekly Announcement Rule

## Purpose
Generate bi-weekly announcement posts for Blade Design System updates by analyzing changelog entries from the past two weeks.

## Instructions

### 1. Data Collection
- **Source**: Use ```git diff``` command to get the changes we shipped in last 2 week or n weeks.
- **Scope**: Include   `packages/blade/` and `packages/blade-mcp/`
- **Time Period**: Calculate the date range for the past two weeks from the current date

### 2. Content Structure
Follow this exact format for the announcement:

```markdown
:blade: Design System Enhancement Updates [Start Date - End Date]
:sparkles: Highlights
  New Components & Features:
[Feature 1]: [Brief description]
[Feature 2]: [Brief description]
[Feature 3]: [Brief description]

Version Updates
[Version Number]
[Component]: [description of change]
[Component]: [description of change]

[Version Number]
[Component]: [description of change]

:github: Check out Blade Releases for the Full Changelog
```

### 3. Content Guidelines

#### Highlights Section
- **New Components**: List any completely new components added
- **Major Features**: Include significant feature additions to existing components
- **Big Fixes**: Include important bug fixes that significantly improve functionality
- **Breaking Changes**: Highlight any breaking changes with clear explanations

#### Version Updates Section
- **Chronological Order**: List versions from newest to oldest
- **Component Focus**: Group changes by component name
- **Clear Descriptions**: Use concise but descriptive language
- **Consistent Format**: Follow the pattern `[Component]: [description]`

### 4. Analysis Process
1. Calculate the two-week period from current date.
  you can use this git command ```  git diff HEAD@{2.weeks.ago} HEAD -- CHANGELOG.md ``` to get the diff. of changes. make sure you get all the diff from the bottom. and use these diff only to write the annoucement. 
2. **Categorize Changes**: 
   - New components/features
   - Bug fixes
   - Improvements
   - Breaking changes
3. **Prioritize Highlights**: Select the most impactful changes for the highlights section
4. **Format Entries**: Ensure consistent formatting and clear descriptions

### 5. Quality Checks
- **Accuracy**: Verify all version numbers and dates are correct
- **Completeness**: Ensure all significant changes are included
- **Clarity**: Use clear, non-technical language when possible
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent formatting throughout

### 6. Example Output Format

### 7. Tools to Use
- **File Reading & Date Calculation**: 
  For now just use blade-mcp and blade.
  Calculate the two-week period from current date.
  you can use this git command ```  git diff HEAD@{2.weeks.ago} HEAD -- CHANGELOG.md ``` to get the diff. of changes. make sure you get all the diff from the bottom. and use these diff only to write the annoucement. 
  make sure you only include changes that are done in given timeline
- **Content Analysis**: Parse and categorize diff changes and include these only
- **Formatting**: Ensure consistent markdown formatting
- **Release link** Add link for github release in https://github.com/razorpay/blade/releases at the end of message
- **Final File Creation** Create a file `announcement.md` in main repo. so it would be easy to copy paste for developers.

### 8. Special Considerations
- **Breaking Changes**: Always highlight breaking changes prominently
- **Performance Improvements**: Include significant performance enhancements
- **Accessibility**: Highlight accessibility improvements
- **Developer Experience**: Include DX improvements and new APIs
