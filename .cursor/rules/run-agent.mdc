## Arguments

- `file-path-or-prompt`: Path to file containing the prompt, or a prompt string directly
- `additional-prompt`: Optional additional prompt to prepend to the main prompt

## Steps to run agent

### In Claude Code

- Claude Code native supports running agents with prompts
- Refer to {file-path-or-prompt} (find existing subagent on that file-path) and {additional-prompt} to run the agent

### In Cursor

- Run the agent with the given prompt using `agentic-tools` command (the command is already installed in machine)
  ```sh
  agentic-tools run-cursor-agent {file-path-or-prompt} {additional-prompt}
  ```

### Important Guidelines

- Do not execute the task on your own or read the agent files. Always run it as subagent using the above mentioned methods
