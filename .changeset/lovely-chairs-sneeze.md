- feat(Dropdown): add E2E tests
- fix(Dropdown): dropdown getting closed without explicit isOpen={false} in controlled dropdown
  
> [!Note]
>
> if you have used ControlledDropdown in a similar way how it was documented, things should work fine.
> 
> If you have used `isOpen` from Controlled Dropdown but you're not handling it inside `onOpenChange`, you will have to handle that state as well. E.g. `isOpen={isDropdownOpen} onOpenChange={(isOpen) => setIsDropdownOpen(isOpen)}`
