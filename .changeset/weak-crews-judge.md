### Line-height scale changes

New scale has been changed to use numbered values for more flexibility, to read more about the changes [check this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16j8dIKuQF9GjDgkhkZwnokVGNeoK7R-7zzIXHCgvveA/edit).

#### **Migration guide:**

Replace old named tokens to corresponding numbered values:

For example:

```diff
- theme.typography.lineHeights.s
+ theme.typography.lineHeights[50]
```

**Old vs New mappings:**

| old | new |
| --- | --- |
| s   | 50  |
| m   | 50  |
| l   | 100 |
| xl  | 200 |
| 2xl | 300 |
| 3xl | 400 |
| 4xl | 600 |
| 5xl | 700 |
| 6xl | 800 |

#### **Migrate with Codemod:**

To change all instances of `theme.typography.lineHeights` to the new scale automatically use this codemod:

**Step1:** Install this version of blade

**Step2:** Run the codemod with the following command

> Checkout [jscodeshift docs](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift) for further cli usage help.

```sh
npx jscodeshift ./YOUR_DIR --extensions=tsx,ts,jsx,js -t ./node_modules/@razorpay/blade/codemods/migrate-typography/transformers/migrate-typography.ts --ignore-pattern="**/node_modules/**"
```

> **Note**
>
> This codemod will cover 80% of the usecases, but it might miss certain edge cases, it is advised to thoroughly test & check the code to ensure nothing is missed.
