# Summary

There are multiple strategies to render content on devices with different screen resolutions. Modern web design gives us three options: Responsive, Adaptive, and Standalone Design. Of these, standalone is rarely used because of the overhead of maintaining multiple codebase and their development lifecycle. Hence, we would just be focussing on Adaptive and Responsive.

1. Responsive - Make the content fluid so it'll render based on the available space
   <img alt="Responsive Search Field" src="./images/responsive-adaptive-layout/responsive-search-field.png">
2. Adaptive - Make content targeted for specific screen sizes so it'll render exactly like that, regardless of the available space.
   <img alt="Adaptive Search Field" src="./images/responsive-adaptive-layout/adaptive-search-field.png">

This RFC will focus on what approach and strategies we shall take in our Design System.

# Basic Example

### Responsive Design

üëáüèª An example of a responsive design where we have modal which is responsive to the screen size and has a `maxWidth` defined for it to render on larger screen sizes, where on smaller screen sizes(mobile) it'll take `100%` of the width of the screen.

<img alt="Responsive Modal" src="./images/responsive-adaptive-layout/responsive-modal.png">

<br/>

### Adaptive Design

üëáüèª An example of a adaptive design where we have two implementation of a search field.

1. Larger Screen Size - Search Input with Autosuggestion
2. Smaller Screen Size - Search Field when clicked opens up a full screen modal which basically gives an optimised search experience on smaller screen size.

<img alt="Responsive Modal" src="./images/responsive-adaptive-layout/adaptive-search-field.png">

# Motivation

### Why are we doing this?

As of today, we don't have well defined strategy or approach in place for designing layouts for different screen sizes. As a result, different teams build things for the use cases at hand. But the moment the products scope increases these challenges kick in and puts people in confusion on how to address those UX challenges to make it work across different devices.

Going Responsive(fluid) without considering the target user audience of the product might not scale. Imagine for example, you have different experiences(styles, javascript) for mobile vs desktop but if we go with responsive without proper considerations we might unnecessary download assets for all the screen sizes our application would run on. For example it would not be an ideal UX to implement [this Search Field](#adaptive-design) as a responsive layout since it'll result in unnecessary download of the assets(modal for mobile) and hence hampering the experience and performance for the consumers.

Similarly, considering adaptive blindly without considering the target user audience of the product might not scale too. We might unnecessary be creating redundant variant of the same component. For example, imagine that we are creating 2 variants of a modal - 1 for desktop(which has a width of `600px`) and 1 for mobile(which has `100%` width). Now we could have just made it responsive by setting the `maxWidth` property of the modal so it could have been `600px` in width on desktop and `100%` in width on mobile. For eg, it is not ideal to create multiple variant of [this Modal](#responsive-design) while we can achieve this through responsive layout by setting `maxWidth` for Modal's Dialog component.

But because we don't have these strategies in place we don't know how to approach building layouts and components for different screen sizes.

### What use cases does it support?

- Components that can handle Responsiveness Internally.
  > Components which which will just change their sizing based on different screen sizes.
- Components that can give some flexibility to handle Responsiveness to consumers.
  > Only components which are wrapper components(once which don't render anything but just enhance the children) eg: layout, spacer, etc.
- Components that render different variants conditionally based on screen sizes, optimising for performance without bloating the bundlesize.
  > Components which have two different variants all together for different screen sizes.

### What is the expected outcome?

We'll basically define the approach and strategy we'll be taking in Blade to build components that will address the concerns of rendering based on different screen sizes.

# Detailed Design

## Responsive Design

- Responsive is fluid and adapts to the size of the screen no matter what the target device is.
- Responsive uses [CSS media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) to change styles based on the target device such as display `type`, `width`, `height`, etc., and only one of these is necessary for the site to adapt to different screens.
- Ensuring that elements fit within a page is not enough. For a responsive design to be successful, the design must also be usable at all screen resolutions and sizes.
  - An example of fluid search field which shrinks/grows based on screen width but isn't usable enough.
    <img alt="Responsive Modal" src="./images/responsive-adaptive-layout/responsive-search-field.png">

### Pros and Cons of Responsive Design

#### Pros

- Abundance of templates to use
- Often easier to implement

#### Cons

- Elements can move around fluidly
- Longer download times.
- Tons of `@media` queries often leads to a maintenance overhead in code.
- Images and other high bandwidth features are simply scaled down rather than resized or eliminated outright(unless added some lines of JS which again degrades the performance and increases the mess in code), elements which may not be vital to user experience can cause poor performance

## Adaptive Design

- While responsive design relies on changing the design pattern to fit the real estate available to it, **adaptive design** has multiple fixed layout sizes. When the site _detects_ the available space, it _selects_ the layout most appropriate for the screen. So, when you open a browser on the desktop, the site chooses the best layout for that screen, resizing the browser has no impact on the design(a reload would be required to see the change).
- Adaptive works to detect the screen size and load the appropriate layout for it ‚Äì generally you would design an adaptive site for six common screen widths(confirm with Saurav once on exact sizes we are doing and update):
  - `320px ‚Äî 480px`: Mobile devices
  - `481px ‚Äî 768px`: Large mobile devices
  - `769px ‚Äî 1024px`: Small screens, Tablets
  - `1025px ‚Äî 1200px`: Desktops
- Because adaptive allows for a different experience between the mobile and desktop versions, products that want to deliver a different experience for their mobile customers can do so without sacrificing quality in either version. It can also be tacked on to an existing site, whereas responsive layout requires rewriting all the original code.
- There was a [case study by Catchpoint](https://www.catchpoint.com/blog/responsive-vs-adaptive) in which they selected 15 examples each of Adaptive and Responsive websites out of the Alexa Top 100 rankings (US), and tested the response times to see how the greater amount of data in responsive sites leads to higher latency. Unsurprisingly, the mobile response times showed a significant variance between Adaptive and Responsive sites.

### Pros and Cons of Adaptive Design

#### Pros

- Allows designers to build the best UX for the appropriate device.
- The system can evaluate the consumers screen resolution and send the appropriate content for them hence, preventing downloading unnecessary assets required for that screen size.
- It offers an alternative to the ‚Äúone-size-stretches-to-all‚Äù approach.

#### Cons

- Takes a lot of effort to implement since now we essentially are implementing multiple versions of the same component for different screen sizes.
- Can leave out users ‚Äúin the middle‚Äù if the screen sizes are not properly defined and the content is not available for a particular screen size

## What would work for us?

As you saw there are pros and cons to each of the approach so we can't abandon either of them but we need to strike a strategy where each of these approaches will work best.

After doing some research and aligning it with our uses cases at Razorpay, I propose following things at a broader level.

### 1. Components that can handle Responsiveness Internally

- Most of the components that don't deal with layouts shall handle responsiveness internally. For eg: Button, Modal, Avatar, Select, etc.

- The properties that affects responsiveness are:

  - `width`
  - `height`
  - `font-size`
  - `padding`
  - `margin`
  - `position`
  - `top`
  - `left`
  - `right`
  - `bottom`

- While a lot of [well known design systems gives flexibility](#approaches-taken-by-well-known-design-systems) on every component for above properties(becuse they might have taken a call to give flexibility to the consumers) to accept responsive values, I can't think of a use case where we'll have to provide similar functionality(because we want to strike a balance of flexibility and constraints, if you go read further we do have layout componments which will give this flexibility). Majority of the cases that I could think of wouldn't be any different even if the consumers define the values for them explicitly. So seems like we'll be adding unnecessary learning curve to the component's API.

  - For eg: all the props(ones that are affected by responsive) for a component will then accept either single value or array/object of values for different screen sizes which is confusing and might lead to a lot of confusion at the API surface.

    ```jsx
    <Text fontSize="100" />

    <Text fontSize={{ small: 100, medium: 100, large: 100, xl: 400 }} />
    ```

- Hence the idea here is that all these components except the Layout components will handle responsiveness based on predefined breakpoints internally without the consumers explicitly defining anything for them.

### 2. Components that can give some flexibility to handle Responsiveness to consumers

- While most of the components can handle responsiveness internally there are use cases for components where we would need to give flexibility to accept responsive values for certain props. For eg: Layout Components that handles the overall layout of the page might change the layout on different screen sizes based on the available space.
  <img alt="Adaptive Layout with flex direction" src="./images/responsive-adaptive-layout/adaptive-layout-with-flex-direction.png">
- The idea here is to have certain components that deal with Layout of the page expose some flexibility to consumers to tweak if they want the layout to look different on different screen sizes

### 3. Components for Adaptive layout(rendering components conditionally)

- After handling responsiveness internally and also giving flexibility for few scenarios there are still few complex cases that we need to handle:

  - There are cases where we might need to render a completely different variation of a component based on the screen size and user experience. For eg: A Search Field component might be different for larger screen sizes and smaller screen sizes.
    <img alt="Responsive Modal" src="./images/responsive-adaptive-layout/adaptive-search-field.png">

  - Another example is to show and hide certain elements based on the screen size so that we can optimise for user experience for each screen size
    <img alt="Responsive Modal" src="./images/responsive-adaptive-layout/adaptive-layout-with-multiple-layouts.png">

- The idea here is to make it feasible for consumers to handle these kind of complex use cases with ease, maybe with a set of predefined components and APIs.

## How will we actually implement the approaches discussed above?

### On Blade Code Side

- To begin with, as a first step we will first need to setup different screen sizes that we'll support and store it in tokens. This will handle our layout changes

  ```
  s: ‚Ää480px // Mobile devices
  m: ‚Ää768px // Large mobile devices
  l: 1024px // Small screens, Tablets
  xl: 1200px // Desktops
  ```

- We would then need to add a listener in the `BladeProvider` which will listen to screen size changes and trigger a layout change.

- For handling typography for different screen sizes we already have 2 scales one for smaller screens which are less than `960px` and the other for larger screens which are greater than `960px`. Now, once the screen size changes, the above listener would trigger a state change and then we can listen to it and swap the scales between small and large screens.
- The typography will scale in segments. Which means if `h1` at `1440px` is `40px`, then at `960px` it will become `32px` directly rather than going from `40px` ‚û°Ô∏è `38px` ‚û°Ô∏è `36px` ‚û°Ô∏è `34px` ‚û°Ô∏è `32px`. You can read more about it in our [Typography Scaling RFC](https://github.com/razorpay/blade/blob/master/rfcs/2021-01-05-typography-scaling.md)
- The obvious question that might come to your mind is that what happens to the content after a breakpoint. For eg: after say `960px` the mobile typography scale would be picked up by the system but there are mobile devices who have resolutions ranging from `320px`, `480px`, `760px`, `960px` so won't the mobile typography scale look too small on say `760px` screen width device? Well, that's the reason we have kept the units of typography to be `rems` so it can adjust to these use cases based on resolutions, browsers font size, etc. This will also handle use cases for high resolution mobile screens for eg: iPhone 12. You can [read more about that in our RFC about units for layout and typography](https://github.com/razorpay/blade/blob/master/rfcs/2021-02-19-units-for-typography-and-layout.md#what-will-work-for-us)

### On Consumer Code Side

Taking the [approaches discussed above](#what-would-work-for-us?)

**1. Components that can handle Responsiveness Internally**

For this to work, on the consumer side nothing has to be done explicitly, as far as the consumers have wrapped their app inside `<BladeProvider><ConsumerApp></BladeProvider>`, the components which will handle responsiveness internally will automatically listen to the screen size changes and scale automatically based on the available space

**2. Components that can give some flexibility to handle Responsiveness to consumers**

Consider, if we want to implement a layout similar to the below mockup
<img alt="Adaptive Layout with flex direction" src="./images/responsive-adaptive-layout/adaptive-layout-with-flex-direction.png">

<br/>

Here's how the consumer will create a layout like this in code(_Note: the actual API might differ_)

```jsx
import { Stack, Card, Title } from '@razorpay/blade/components';

const Dashboard = () => (
  <Stack direction={{ s: 'column', l: 'row' }}>
    <Card>
      <Title>This is Card Title</Title>
      <Content>This is Card Content</Content>
    </Card>
    <Card>
      <Title>This is Card Title</Title>
      <Content>This is Card Content</Content>
    </Card>
    <Card>
      <Title>This is Card Title</Title>
      <Content>This is Card Content</Content>
    </Card>
  </Stack>
);

export default Dashboard;
```

**3. Components for Adaptive layout(rendering components conditionally)**

- Consider, if we want to implement a layout similar to the below mockup where we have 2 different search inputs for different screens of the same web app.
  <img alt="Responsive Modal" src="./images/responsive-adaptive-layout/adaptive-search-field.png">

  <br/>

  Here's how the consumer will create a layout like this in code(_Note: the actual API might differ_).

  ```jsx
  import { LargeSearchInput, SmallSearchInput } from '@razorpay/blade/components';

  const SearchScreen = () => (isMobile ? <SmallSearchInput /> : <LargeSearchInput />);

  export default SearchScreen;
  ```

  Now, there's an issue with this approach. If you look we are importing both the components(LargeSearchInput, SmallSearchInput) for both the screens(Desktop/Mobile) which will unnecessary increase the bundlesize and hamper the performance. So to solve this we shall use [`React.Lazy`](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy) if you're doing client side rendering or [`@loadable/component`](https://loadable-components.com/docs/component-splitting/) if you're doing server side rendering. Let's see how we can load them lazily

  ```jsx
  // With React.Lazy
  import { Suspense } from 'react';

  const LargeSearchInput = React.lazy(() => import('@razorpay/blade/components'));
  const SmallSearchInput = React.lazy(() => import('@razorpay/blade/components'));

  const SearchScreen = () => (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      {isMobile ? <SmallSearchInput /> : <LargeSearchInput />}
    </Suspense>
  );

  export default SearchScreen;
  ```

  ```jsx
  // With @loadable/components
  import loadable from '@loadable/component';

  const LargeSearchInput = loadable(() => import('@razorpay/blade/components'));
  const SmallSearchInput = loadable(() => import('@razorpay/blade/components'));

  const SearchScreen = () => (isMobile ? <SmallSearchInput /> : <LargeSearchInput />);

  export default SearchScreen;
  ```

- Consider, another example where we want to show and hide bunch of components based on different screen sizes.
  <img alt="Responsive Modal" src="./images/responsive-adaptive-layout/adaptive-layout-with-multiple-layouts.png">

  <br/>

  Here's how we'll implement the above mockup in code

  ```jsx
  import loadable from '@loadable/component';
  import { Stack, Card, Title, Hidden, Avatar, Divider } from '@razorpay/blade/components';

  const DesktopNavBar = loadable(() => import('@razorpay/blade/components'));
  const MobileNavBar = loadable(() => import('@razorpay/blade/components'));
  const BottomNavBar = loadable(() => import('@razorpay/blade/components'));

  const Dashboard = () => (
    <Stack direction={{ s: 'column', l: 'row' }}>
      {isMobile ? <MobileNavBar /> : <DesktopNavbar />}
      <Stack direction="column">
        <Hidden hide={{ s: true, l: false }}>
          <Stack direction="row" justifyContent="space-between">
            <div>some profile information</div>
            <Stack direction="row">
              <Avatar />
              <Avatar />
            </Stack>
          </Stack>
        </Hidden>
        <Stack direction={{ s: 'column', l: 'row' }}>
          <Card>
            <Title>This is Card Title</Title>
            <Content>This is Card Content</Content>
          </Card>
          <Card>
            <Title>This is Card Title</Title>
            <Content>This is Card Content</Content>
          </Card>
          <Card>
            <Title>This is Card Title</Title>
            <Content>This is Card Content</Content>
          </Card>
        </Stack>
      </Stack>
      <Hidden hide={{ s: false, l: true }}>
        <BottomNavBar />
      </Hidden>
    </Stack>
  );
  ```

  So here we have introduced a new utility component called `Hidden` which accepts responsive props and enables us to hide/show component based on different screen sizes

  > The `isMobile` logic can be be abstracted out withing Blade or left upto consumers, there are pros and cons to both the approaches hence we shall evaluate this case by case basis and it's out of scope of this document.

### On Blade Design Side

While building components on Figma we have to keep in mind following things:

1. If the component is responsive, then design it for all the screens and properly define/document the responsive properties.

   - `width`
   - `height`
   - `font-size`
   - `padding`
   - `margin`
   - `top`
   - `left`
   - `right`
   - `bottom`

2. If the component is adaptive, then design it for all the screens and explicitly mention about the multiple variations of a component for different screen sizes.
   > We'll have to follow some naming convention to explicitly highlight and communicate to the consumers that a particular component has different variant for mobile vs desktop.

### On Consumer Design Side

When designing layouts and consuming components from Design System Library on Figma make sure to do following things:

1. Design the mockups for all the different screen sizes.
   1. You can follow this nice guide on [how to start defining content for multiple screen sizes](https://web.dev/responsive-web-design-basics/#breakpoints)
2. Pick the right version of the component for respective screen sizes using component variants in Figma.
3. If for different screen sizes you want to render entirely different components(adaptive) then make sure to highlight it properly so the developers can understand it properly

# FAQ

## Question: Our strategy consists of

1. **_Automatic_ Responsive**: Components will change pre-defined properties based on pre-defined screen sizes automatically
2. **_Configurable_ Responsive**: Components will change pre-defined properties based on pre-defined screen sizes as per a configuration passed by the consumer. Eg) `direction={{ s: 'column', l: 'row' }}`
3. **_Configurable_ Adaptive?**: Components will change entirely based on the consumer's logic for screen sizes. Eg) `{isMobile ? <SmallSearchInput /> : <LargeSearchInput />}`

**You might 2 broad questions,**

1. Why is there no _Automatic_ Adaptive?

   As per the example mentioned for `LargeSearchInput` & `SmallSearchInput`, we expect our consumers to import both of these(in a bundle optimized manner) and apply their own logic to render either of the two (this is why I am calling it "Configurable" since the control is on the consumer end)

   Similarly, can there not be components that are **_Automatically_ Adaptive**? For example, a SearchInput that internally renders `LargeSearchInput` or `SmallSearchInput` based on the screen size.

   A valid use-case here could be a `Dropdown` component where we _know_(\*assuming it here) that we always want the dropdown to be almost fullscreen on mobile but a relatively small pop-over menu on desktop. Consumers can just import `Dropdown` and blade can internally render the `MobileDropdown` or `DesktopDropdown` based on the current screen size and take away the complexity of adding any logical checks for the consumers.

2. How do we communicate to consumers that a component they are using is Responsive or Adaptive?

   As a consumer of blade, how would I know if a component **ComponentA** is automatically responsive or I need to pass it some props for it to become responsive or is it adaptive and I need to import another **SmallComponentA** and add `isMobile` check to be able to render it properly on a mobile device?

Supporting multiple strategies can introduce a huge learning curve for the consumer. Something as simple as trying to use a prop like `direction={{ s: 'column', l: 'row' }}` on an Automatic Responsive component. Eg) Typography is automatically responsive but what if a consumer tries to pass `fontSize={{ small: 100, medium: 100, large: 100, xl: 400 }}` and expects it to work?

We can throw warnings or show TS errors but in the end, our components behave differently from one another. Where a `Text` component automatically takes care of screen sizes on its own, we are expecting our consumers to still worry about screen sizes because the `SearchInput` component is not going to look different on different screen sizes until the consumer adds conditional rendering to it.

The concern is not the fact that we're allowing all strategies but the added overhead for consumers to think and understand each component's behavior with screen sizes deeply before using them anywhere.

We can do this internally it's not a big deal but that's exactly a reason why it's adaptive and not responsive. if it was just scaling or little things to change we could have made it responsive but adaptive itself means the implementation(UX, interactions, etc) could be different for the mobile variant vs a desktop variant.

for eg: I have a search field on for desktop which shows auto suggestions as a dropdown but its mobile variant is a full-screen modal that has filters in it, recent searches section(whose results can be fetched via some API) now I can't handle this use case internally else I've to create another wrapper which will expect all the things from consumers for supporting both the variants but it seems like messing our component API.

Surely we can consider this approach where the APIs will be the same for both the variants but then it's just the matter of why can't it be then a responsive component if only the layout changes.

Even if we go ahead with this approach we might have to consider the developer(on design system side) overhead where they'll be confused of when to handle `isMobile` internally vs leaving it to the end consumers because we can't avoid different APIs for different variants.

Another point to consider is that every client might have a different way of lazy loading. for csr people might use `React.Lazy` but for SSR they might have to use loadable components. Now the moment we generalize this people will have concerns and differences of opinions plus unnecessary dependencies because I can just use `React.Lazy` for csr why shall someone install loadable. (yes it's arguable and as Design System owners we might have to take that hard call in favor of constraints vs flexibility).

But we can surely keep this approach into consideration and while this RFC is mostly about an overview of how we'll handle different strategies for supporting these layouts the implementation details are still left out and we'll take it on case by case basis.

Something as simple as trying to use a prop like `direction={{ s: 'column', l: 'row' }}` on an Automatic Responsive component. Eg) Typography is automatically responsive but what if a consumer tries to pass `fontSize={{ small: 100, medium: 100, large: 100, xl: 400 }}` and expects it to work?

Where a `Text` component automatically takes care of screen sizes on its own, we are expecting our consumers to still worry about screen sizes because the `SearchInput` component is not going to look different on different screen sizes until the consumer adds conditional rendering to it.

This is only for layout components. We aren't supporting multiple ways of achieving same things.

So if you [read here](https://github.com/razorpay/blade/pull/416/files#diff-f4d103560de689c11de7f41e8dbd9106c41e45f89247d0d2508f9150040c463dR85)

We say:

- Components that can handle Responsiveness Internally. **Components affecting layouts and sizes**
- Components that can give some flexibility to handle Responsiveness to consumers. **Only layout components, basically wrappers that helps you create layouts**
- Components that render different variants conditionally based on screen sizes, optimising for performance without bloating the bundlesize. **Components which have two different variants all together**
