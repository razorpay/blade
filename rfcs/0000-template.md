# Summary
Brief explanation about the proposal.

# Basic Example
Include a basic code example. Omit this section if it's not applicable.

# Motivation
- Why are we doing this?
- What use cases does it support?
- What is the expected outcome?

Try to focus on explaining the motivation so that if this RFC is not accepted, the motivation could be used to develop alternative solutions. In other words, try to list down the constraints you are trying to solve without coupling them too closely to the solution you have in mind.

# Detailed Design
This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with the Design System to understand, and for somebody familiar with the implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be defined here.

# Drawbacks/Constraints
Why should we *not* do this? Maybe try to consider the following constraints
- Implementation cost, both in terms of code size and complexity.
- The impact of it on new as well as existing consumer projects.
- Cost of migration.

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

# Alternatives
What other designs/patterns/strategies have been considered?

# Adoption strategy
If we implement this proposal, how will existing consumer projects adopt it? 
- Is this a breaking change? 
- Can we write a codemod?
- How do we prioritise this with business and product folks?
- How do we communicate with other teams? Will updating docs suffice or do we need a dedicated interaction with them?

# How do we educate people?
- How should this be taught to other folks?
- What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? 
- How is this idea best presented?

# Open Questions
- Any open questions that you have?
- Any undiscovered areas that you have encountered?
- Any dependencies on other teams(Design/Engineering) that needs to be resolved upfront?

# References
Any references that you can share for those who are curious to understand anything beyond the scope of this RFC in general but related to the topic of this RFC.
