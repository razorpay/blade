## Summary

After Brand Refresh, we have 2 major fonts. `Inter` and `TASA Orbiter`.

So far when we had Lato, we could load it from `@fontsource/lato`. But TASA Orbiter does not exist on fontsource and we also selectively load weights from Inter and Lato.

This document is created to explore and decide on what should be the font loading strategy after brand refresh

## Proposed Solution

### Web

Consumers add import from `@razorpay/blade/fonts.css` which sets the font face and loads the fonts

```js
// index.tsx
import '@razorpay/blade/fonts.css';
```

Consumers add font on `body` in their global Styled Components File with-

```js
// With styled-components
const GlobalStyles = createGlobalStyles`
  body {
    font-family: ${(theme) => theme.typography.fonts.family.text}
  }
`;
```

Live Example (POC): https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/saurabhdaware/blade-self-hosted-font/tree/blade-import-css?file=index.tsx

### React Native

In React Native, people will continue to load the font the way they do right now (Download font files, link them to android and ios projects)

Refer: https://blade.razorpay.com/?path=/docs/guides-installation--docs#react-native-projects

## Detailed Design

### Criteria for font loading strategy

Our recommended font loading strategy should find a good balance between following criteria

- **Performance**
  Should load fonts fast enough without impacting performance on rest of the app.

- **DX**
  Should not take significant amount of time and effort on consumer's end. Should be easy to load fonts.

### Explored Solutions

#### 1. Self Hosted: Manual Method

- Download font files from respective sites
- Define font-face in your CSS

**Pros:**

- Since consumers know the final font URL, they can be preloaded
- Self-hosted so does not require additional DNS connection and thus fonts load faster (no preconnect required)

**Cons:**

- Consumers need to make sure fallbacks are set properly for browsers
- Consumers need to make sure the place where fonts are hosted are correctly cached on CDN
- Consumers need to make sure the correct lightweight fonts are used with correct configurations
- Time consuming method to implement

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'TASA Orbiter';
  src: url('/fonts/TASAOrbiterVF.woff2') format('woff2-variations');
  font-weight: 125 950;
  font-stretch: 75% 125%;
  font-style: normal;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Inter';
  src: url('/fonts/Inter-Regular.ttf') format('truetype');
  font-weight: normal;
  font-style: normal;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: 'Inter';
  src: url('/fonts/Inter-SemiBold.ttf') format('truetype');
  font-weight: 600;
  font-style: normal;
}
```

CSR apps can also add preloads to fonts to load them faster

```html
<link rel="preload" href="/fonts/TASAOrbiterVF.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin />
<link rel="preload" href="/fonts/Inter-Regular.ttf" as="font" type="font/ttf" crossorigin />
<link rel="preload" href="/fonts/Inter-SemiBold.ttf" as="font" type="font/ttf" crossorigin />
```

<!-- #### Difference between loading fonts without preload and with preload

#### 2. Self Hosted: Using CSS Imports from Blade (‚úÖ Preferred)

Similar to how we load Lato font from `@fontsource/lato` right now, Consumers add import from `@razorpay/blade/fonts.css`

```js
import '@razorpay/blade/fonts.css';
```

**Pros:**

- Easy Implementation
- Self-hosted so does not require additional DNS connection and thus fonts load faster
- Font names, font files, fallbacks for browsers, definition of fonts, is taken care by Blade
- We can change font-weights, styles, etc without any additional migration for consumers

**Cons:**

- Fonts cannot be preloaded with HTML preload in CSR apps (SSR apps can loop through their build manifest to know the font URLs and preload them if required)

#### 3. Contribute TASA Orbiter to fontsource

TASA Orbiter is compatible with license requirements of fontsource. Thus we can contribute TASA Orbiter to fontsource open-source repo and then use fonts from fontsource.

**Pros:**

- We won't have to keep font files in Blade package
- Pros of self hosting like no DNS connection etc
- Easy Implementation

**Cons:**

- We cannot define fonts from Blade which means consumer has to make sure to load the correct font variants (e.g. using variable font in TASA Orbiter and using static fonts in Inter)
- Changing font weights, font styles, variants will require consumer migration of imports
- Dependency on fontsource reviews thus can take time to implement

> [!Note]
>
> We will be contributing TASA Orbiter to fontsouce although we'll go with method 2 due to the cons mentioned above.

#### 4. Host fonts on Razorpay's CDN

Similar to how you install from google font, except we can have `https://cdn.razorpay.com/blade/fonts.css` kind of URL.

**Pros:**

- Easy Implementation
- Font definitions are taken care by blade
- Can be preloaded

**Cons:**

- More implementation and maintainance cost since we don't have well-owned CDN currently
- Requires additional DNS connection before fonts start to load
- Unlike method 2, this cannot be versioned or easily be kept in-sync with Blade's version

#### 5. Load from existing third-party CDN

While Inter can be loaded from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter), TASA Orbiter can be loaded from [CDNFonts](https://www.cdnfonts.com/tasa-orbiter-display.font)

Cons from all of the above üôà

## Implementation Details

### Font Size Optimization

To optimize on font-size, we are splitting fonts into multiple files.

- `inter-latin-blade.woff2` (alphabets, numbers, common symbols, currency) [~80kb]
- `inter-latin-blade-extra.woff2` (rare symbols, extra glyphs) [~100kb]
- Other bundles of greek, vietnamese, cyrillic files

we are defining these files using [`unicode-range`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/unicode-range) so most sites will always load only one `inter-latin-blade.woff2` file.

### Variable Fonts vs Static Fonts

Should Blade load variable fonts or static-fonts?

The performance of variable font vs static font depends on how many weights and styles are being used, the size of that particular font in itself, etc.

These are the weights and styles being used right now

**TASA Orbiter:** 400, 500, 600
**Inter:** 400, 500, 600

**Conclusion**

We'll be using variable fonts in both TASA and Inter based on the size below-

|                  | **Static**                 | **Variable**                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Inter**        | 70kb \* 3 weights = ~210kb | ‚úÖ **~215kb (80kb latin file)** |
| **TASA Orbiter** | 30kb \* 3 weights = ~90kb  | ‚úÖ **~32kb**                    |

> [!Note]
>
> The 80kb file size of Inter comes from our custom glyphs that we're using in Razorpay as mentioned in [Font Size Optimization](#font-size-optimization).

### Font Fallbacks

```css
 {
  font-family: 'TASA Orbiter', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, San Francisco, Segoe UI, Roboto, Helvetica
      Neue, sans-serif;

  font-family: 'Inter', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, San Francisco, Segoe UI, Roboto, Helvetica
      Neue, sans-serif;

  font-family: ‚ÄúMenlo‚Äù, San Francisco Mono, Courier New, Roboto Mono, monospace;
}
```
