## üì¶ Packages
Blade has 2 packages
### [`@razorpay/blade`](https://github.com/razorpay/blade/tree/master/packages/blade)
This package is under **active development**. In this `README` we'll only refer to this version of blade.
### [`@razorpay/blade-old`](https://github.com/razorpay/blade/tree/master/packages/blade-old)
This package is under **maintenance** and it won't have any major releases. It will be **deprecated** once the newer version (`@razorpay/blade`) is ready for a stable release. Documentation for this package can be found [here](https://github.com/razorpay/blade/blob/master/packages/blade-old/README.md)
## üèÅ Getting Started
### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
#### ‚úçüèª Pre-requisite
Before you install the package, make sure that you have performed following steps:
Before using universe just ensure following things

* You must be running Node version >=14.0.0
* You must have `yarn` installed
* Generate a Personal Access Token on GitHub by [visiting this link](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,workflow,write:packages,read:repo_hook,write:packages)
  - If you belong to razorpay organisation then you will need to enable SSO by clicking `Authorize` button next to Razorpay logo.
* Run `code ~/.bashrc` or `code ~/.zshrc` in your editor and add this line 
  ```
  export GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN="<YOUR_TOKEN>"
  ```
  > Note: Replace `<YOUR_TOKEN>` with your actual GitHub Personal Access Token
* Run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` based on the file you added your token.
* Run `code ~/.npmrc` and append the following
```bash
# add following to your .npmrc
@razorpay:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
//npm.pkg.github.com/:always-auth=true
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN}
```
#### ‚¨áÔ∏è Add blade to your application
```shell
yarn add @razorpay/blade
```
#### üîú Add blade libraries to your figma project

### üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Local Development
#### Testing Local Changes
We have all the examples under `packages/examples` directory. To run any example project with the updated changes follow the steps below:

1. Setup the example project
    ```shell
    cd packages/examples/<example-name>
    yarn
    ```

2. Publish the blade package with your changes using [`yalc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yalc).
    ```shell
    # run this from packages/blade directory
    npx yalc publish
    ```

3. Install the updated `blade` package using [`yalc`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yalc).
    ```shell
    # run this from packages/examples/<example-name> directory
    npx yalc add @razorpay/blade
    ```

4. Run the example project and verify the changes
    ```shell
    # this script can vary based on the kind of project so check the example `package.json` to find the relevant script to start the project
    yarn start
    ```

#### Running Tests
We use `react-testing-library` for writing tests. If you want to write platform specific tests then suffix the test file with `filename.native.ts` or `filename.web.ts`

* To run the tests for react web projects follow the steps below:
  ```shell
  cd packages/blade
  yarn test:react
  ```
* To run the tests for react-native projects follow the steps below:
  ```shell
  cd packages/blade
  yarn test:react-native
  ```
> To update the snapshots run the test commands with `-u` as suffix

### üëÄ How to use blade?
#### Tokens
To start using tokens in your application you can follow these steps:
1. Wrap your App with `BladeProvider` and pass it `paymentTheme` or `bankingTheme` tokens.
```jsx
// App entry point
import { BladeProvider } from '@razorpay/blade/components';
import { paymentTheme } from '@razorpay/blade/tokens';

function App(): JSX.Element {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <BladeProvider themeTokens={paymentTheme}>
        <Card />
      </BladeProvider>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}

export default App;
```
2. You can also pass an optional `colorScheme` prop to the `BladeProvider` mentioning whether you want the `light`, `dark` or `system`'s default color scheme. The default is `light`.
```jsx
<BladeProvider themeTokens={paymentTheme} colorScheme='dark'>
   <Card/>
</BladeProvider>
```
3. After you've wrapped your App with `BladeProvider`, you can use the `useTheme()` hook to get access to the current theme context.
```jsx
import { useTheme, Theme } from '@razorpay/blade/components';

const Card = (): React.ReactElement => {
  const { theme } = useTheme();
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <DisplayLarge theme={theme}>Cash Advance</DisplayLarge>
      <StyledCard theme={theme}>
        <CaptionRegular theme={theme}>
          This amount will be deducted in 3 installments from your settlement balance between Feb
          18-20 on a daily basis.
        </CaptionRegular>
      </StyledCard>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
};

const StyledCard = styled.div(
  ({ theme }: { theme: Theme }) => `
    width: 368px;
    background-color: ${theme.colors.surface.background.level2.lowContrast};
    border-radius: ${theme.border.radius.medium}px;
    padding: ${theme.spacing[5]}px;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
`,
);
```

## üìù Versioning & Publishing
* The first step in publishing a new version of blade is to first the mention the type of change and bump the version. We are using [`changesets`](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets) to handle automated versioning for us based on the intent of the change we mention in the PR.
* Once a PR is approved by the authors of blade, based on if the PR needs a new version to be published the author will add a changeset to the PR.
* After the `changeset` is added and the PR is merged the `release` workflow gets triggered by GitHub actions.
* The `release` workflow runs `build` script which runs rollup to bundle `blade` and generates relevant `types` as well.
* After the build script finishes, we'll have 3 bundles which will be published under `@razorpay/blade` scope
```
@razorpay/blade/components
@razorpay/blade/tokens
@razorpay/blade/utils
```

## ‚åõÔ∏è Current State
Here's a glimpse of where we are currently in our journey of building the design system.
![current-state-image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11384858/138659745-e3dc1f6a-96c0-4170-bc10-6de2df6b24bb.png)
## ü§ù How to contribute
To contribute to this project you should follow these things:

1. Open an [issue](https://github.com/razorpay/blade/issues/new/choose) with all the details mentioned in the issue template.

2. Discuss possible solutions and approaches on the issue itself and once finalized, you can start working on implementing the solution.

3. Ensure you write the necessary tests or update existing tests/snapshots wherever required.
   > Read how to test your changes [here](#running-tests)

4. Make sure to add/update the examples under `packages/examples/tokens-usage` directory.

5. Checkout a new branch with the type of change you're committing and the module it's affecting. The type of change could be one of `fix, feat, chore, docs, ci, refactor, build` followed by `/` followed by a very short description. For eg: `feat/add-component-button`

6. Stage all your files and run `git commit`. This will lint the staged files, prettify them and then run the unit tests.

7. Once all the checks are passed you'll be shown a prompt. Follow the steps in the prompt and fill in the relevant information. We use semantic commit messages. An example of semantic commit message is shown below.

  ```
  feat: allow overriding of webpack config
  ^--^  ^------------^
  |     |
  |     +-> Summary in present tense.
  |
  +-------> Type: chore, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, test etc.
  ```

7. Push the branch, open a PR and add a link to the issue that you had opened in the PR description.
